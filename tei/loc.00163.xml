				<note type="project" target="#dat1">Lines and phrases on both sides of this manuscript leaf contributed to portions of the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself," and possibly to other sections of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, suggesting a composition date before 1855. However, this manuscript also includes lines that probably contributed to "Sun-Down Poem" (later retitled "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry") in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Edward Grier notes that while this may indicate that the manuscript was composed at various times before and after 1855, the "date of the earliest drafts of 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry' may well have been before 1855" (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:165).</note>
