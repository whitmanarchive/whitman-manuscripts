				<note type="project" target="#dat1">Lines and phrases on both sides of this manuscript leaf contributed to portions of the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself," indicating a composition date before 1855. However, the manuscript also includes lines that contributed to "Sun-Down Poem" (later retitled "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry") in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Edward Grier notes that while this may indicate that the manuscript was composed at various times before and after 1855, the "date of the earliest drafts of 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry' may well have been before 1855" (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:165).</note>

			<p>Several of these phrases and lines are related to portions of the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself." The manuscript line that reads "A mother as well as father, a child as well as a man" becomes, in the first poem of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, the line "Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man." And several manuscript lines, beginning with "Not only an American..." become, in the poem, the lines beginning "Not merely of the New World..." Edward Grier speculates that Whitman's note to "Don't forget the bombardment" is in reference to the "bombardment" of the "old artillerist" in "Song of Myself."</p>

			<p>Several phrases of this prose were later used, in somewhat revised form, in a line for "Sun-down Poem" in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>.

A portion of the manuscript reads: "I doubt whether my greatest thoughts, as I had supposed them, are not shallow.&#8212;and people will most likely laugh at me."

			<p>It is possible that some of these poetic lines contributed to the preface to the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The idea of common people being greater than Presidents or Major Generals (from the manuscript) may be related to the sentence from the Preface that reads: "Other states indicate themselves in their deputies....but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors...but always most in the common people."
