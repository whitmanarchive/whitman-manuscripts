        <work ref="xxx.00115"><p>The last two phrases of this manuscript were used in the "Poem of Joys," first published in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>: "The memory of only one look&#8212;the boy lingering and waiting" (p. 261). The poem was retitled "Poems of Joy" in the 1867 edition. In 1871, when the poem appeared in the volume <hi rend="italic">Passage to India</hi>, this line had been deleted and the original title restored. Some copies of the 1871&#8211;1872 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> include the sheets from that volume. In subsequent editions, the poem was retitled "A Song of Joys."</p></work>
