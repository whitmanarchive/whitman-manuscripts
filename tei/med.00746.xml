        <work ref="xxx.00526"><p>This manuscript includes lines that would appear, in slightly altered form, in the Preface to the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The manuscript's questioning of whether there is "only one Supreme" relates to a section from the Preface that begins "Did you suppose there could be only one Supreme?"</p></work>
        <work ref="xxx.00221"><p>The same lines from this manuscript that were used in the 1855 Preface later became part of the poem eventually titled "By Blue Ontario's Shore." It was first published in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as "Poem of the Many in One."</p></work>

            <ab>The new theologies bring forward man&#8212;There is nothing in the universe any more divine than man. All gathers to the worship of man&#8212;How awful, how beautiful a being&#8212;How full of Gods is the world&#8212;There are none greater than these present ones&#8212;Why has it been taught that there is only one Supreme?&#8212;I say there are and must be myriads of Supremes. I say that that is blasphemous petty and infidel which denies any immortal soul to be eligible to advance onward to be as supreme as any&#8212;I say that all goes on to be eligible to become one of the Supremes&#8212;</ab>
