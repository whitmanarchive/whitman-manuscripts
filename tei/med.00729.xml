                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Lines from this manuscript were used in the Preface to the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The sentence that begins "The soul has that measureless pride..." in addition to being used in the 1855 Preface, would later become part of the poem "Song of Prudence." Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances or date of its composition, but it seems likely that it was written before or early in 1855.</note>

            <p>Not to dazzle with profuse descriptions of character and events and passions. The greatest poet is not content with dazzling his rays over character and events and passions and scenery and does not descend to moralize or make applications of morals. The soul has that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any lessions but its own . . . this invariably. But to bring the Spirit of all events and persons and passions to the formation of the one individual that hears or reads . . . of you up there now.</p>
