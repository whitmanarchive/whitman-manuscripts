                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This cancelled prose manuscript includes language that contributed to Whitman's published poetry. The wording of "the vast elemental sympathy, which, only the human soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods," was used, slightly revised, in "A Song of Joys," which first appeared in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as "Poem of Joys." The segment "descend from the tips of his fingers, from the smell of his body, from the vapor of his lungs" was revised and used in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> in the poem that was eventually titled "Song of Myself." Therefore, this manuscript was probably written prior to the publication of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, likely between 1850 and 1855.</note>
