                <note type="project" target="#dat1">A cancelled prose manuscript containing lines which contributed to Whitman's published poetry. The line which reads, "the vast elemental sympathy which, only the human soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods," was used, slightly revised, in "A Song of Joys," which first appeared in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, as "Poem of Joys." The line which reads, "descend from the tips of his fingers from the smell of his body from the vapor of his lungs" was revised and used in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> in the poem that was eventually titled "Song of Myself" (in what would become section 39 in later versions of the poem). Therefore, this manuscript was composed prior to the first publication of <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, likely between 1850 and 1855.</note>
