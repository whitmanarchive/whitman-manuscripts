      <p>"Sweet Flag" includes the phrase "polished melons," which is reminiscent of "the polish'd breasts of melons" in what ultimately became section 49, line 1287 in "Song of Myself." Also, The list on this manuscript  includes "Sweet flag," "Sweet fern," and "Calamus," and may be related to what later became section 24, line 536 of "Song of Myself," which reads, in part, "Root of washed sweet-flag, timorous pond-snipe, nest of guarded duplicate eggs, it shall be you."</p>

      <p>The following jottings on this manuscript appear to have contributed to the poem eventually titled "The Sleepers": "I am a look / mystic / in a trance/ exaltation." In the untitled version of the poem first published in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> the relevant line reads, "I am a dance . . . . Play up there! the fit is whirling me fast." Further, the reference in this manuscript to the soothing hand is perhaps an early version of the passage in which the narrator, who stands "with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and restless," passes his "hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them." Finally, the passage about "trickle drops" from the "manly maple" (associated in the manuscript with the "tooth of delight" and "tooth prong") probably contributed to the following passage in the same poem: "The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness, / And liquor is spilled on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the best liquor afterward." These lines were removed from the final edition of the poem.</p>

        <note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman likely drafted this manuscript in the early 1850s as he was composing the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass.</hi> This manuscript, filled with suggestive words and phrases, appears to have contributed to the first and fourth poems in the volume, both titled "Leaves of Grass" and now more commonly known by their final titles, "Song of Myself" and "The Sleepers," respectively.<lb/><lb/> The phrase "Bulbs of life-lilies, polished melons" prefigures "polished breasts of melons" in "Song of Myself," and the list in this manuscript may relate to the following line: "Root of washed sweet-flag, timorous pond-snipe, nest of guarded duplicate eggs, it shall be you." Other elements of this manuscript appear to have contributed to "The Sleepers." The jotting "I am a look / mystic / in a trance/ exaltation" may have led to the line "I am a dance . . . . Play up there! the fit is whirling me fast." Further, the reference to the soothing hand is perhaps an early version of the passage in which the narrator, who stands "with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and restless," passes his "hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them." Finally, the passage about "Sap that flows from the end of the manly maple" (associated in the manuscript with the "tooth of delight" and "tooth prong") probably contributed to the following passage in the same poem: "The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness, / And liquor is spilled on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the best liquor afterward." These lines were removed from the final edition of the poem.</note>
