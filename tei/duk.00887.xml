        <note type="project">Edward Grier notes that the name "Bill Guess" does not appear in New York directories from this time period.  Two entries for "George Fitch" are listed in the New York City directory for 1855&#8211;56.  One Fitch is listed as an expressman, and the other is listed as a clerk. Grier postulates that "the three young men mentioned here were probably itinerant omnibus drivers" (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:199). See also "<ref target="duk.00294">Bloom</ref>."</note>
