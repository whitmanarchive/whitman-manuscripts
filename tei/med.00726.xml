        <work ref="xxx.00048"><p>This manuscript likely contributed to the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself." Whitman mentions the "superb wonder of a blade of grass," as well as referencing the term "Koboo," which appeared in the poem in 1855. The idea of "[e]nter[ing] into the thoughts of the different theological faiths" (described in this manuscript) can also be connected to the stanza of "Song of Myself" that begins "I do not despise you priests..."</p></work>
