     <p>Walt Whitman said: <add place="inline" hand="#h02">My friends, though announced to give an address, there is no such intention.</add></p>
     <p>Following the impulse of the spirit, (for I am at least half of Quaker stock) I have obeyed the command to come and look at you<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h02">, my friends,</del> for a minute, and show myself, face to face; which is probably the best I can do. But I have felt no command to make a speech; and shall not therefore attempt any. All I have felt the imperative conviction to say I have already printed in my books of poems or prose; to which I refer any who may be curious. And so, hail and farewell. Deeply acknowledging this deep compliment, with my best respects and love to you personally&#8212;to Camden&#8212;to New-Jersey, and to all represented here&#8212;you must excuse me from any word further.</p>
