                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript was likely composed in December 1864. "Visits among the Army Hospitals," published in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of December 11, 1864, included the section "Writing Letters by the Bedside." Whitman's "Hospital Scenes and Persons" from <hi rend="italic">Specimen Days</hi> (1882) also includes anecdotes about Whitman's letter writing that seem to draw on these notes.</note>

                <p>I do a good deal of this, of course. Many have not written home to parents, <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion">wives,</add> brothers, sisters, for a long, long time. They are poor writers, have no paper or envelopes, or something else. Many have an aversion to writing because they don't want to worry the folks at home&#8212;the facts are too sad to tell. Still, I generally encourage them to write, and have written all sorts of missives, (including love letters.)
