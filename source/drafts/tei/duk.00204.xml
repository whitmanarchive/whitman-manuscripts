        <note type="project">In the Trent Collection, this manuscript is bound with three other manuscript leaves and two newspaper clippings, also about members of Whitman's family. It is not clear, however, whether Whitman or a collector bound together the items, which are on different sizes and types of paper and were written at different times.</note>
        <note type="project" target="#leaf001v">No image of verso currently available.</note>
        <note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman's date of October 29, 1862 likely refers both to the date of composition of this manuscript on Captain Williams' daughters and to the day that his mother's aunt visited him on Portland Avenue. Whitman resided at Portland Avenue from May 1859 until he left New York for Virginia in search of his brother George, who had been wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, in December 1862.</note>
