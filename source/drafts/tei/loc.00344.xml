     <p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a071">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a071">/</metamark></add></subst> if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it show'd me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous'd (of course, I don't mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions)&#8212;that only from the strong glare and provocation of that war's sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.</p>
     <p>I went down to the war fields in Virginia (end of 1862), lived thenceforward in camp&#8212;saw great battles and the days and nights afterward&#8212;partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous'd, courage evoked&#8212;death readily risk'd&#8212;<hi rend="italic">the cause</hi>, too&#8212;along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, 1863&#8211;'64&#8211;'65&#8212;the real parturition years (more than 1776&#8211;'83) of this henceforth homogenous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, "Leaves of Grass" would not now be existing.</p>
     <p>But I set out with the intention also of indicating or hinting some point-characteristics which I since see (though I did not then, at least not definitely) were bases and object-urgings toward those "Leaves" from the first. The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last, is the word Suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought&#8212;there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus-word is Comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledg'd sense than hitherto. Other word-signs would be Good Cheer, Content, and Hope.</p>
     <p>The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of Humanity and Nature&#8212;the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. What kind of temper and what amount of faith report these things? Up to how recent a date is the song carried? What the equipment, and special raciness of the singer&#8212;what his tinge of coloring? The last value of artistic expressers, past and present&#8212;Greek <add hand="#h02" place="inline"><metamark function="add" target="#a052"/></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a052">&#230;</add>sthetes, Shakspere&#8212;or in out own day Tennyson, Victor Hugo, Carlyle, Emerson&#8212;is certainly involv'd in such questions. I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect, or supply something polish'd and interesting, nor even to depict great passions, or persons or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <hi rend="italic">good heart</hi> as a radical possession and habit. The educated world seems to have been growing more and more ennuyed for ages, leaving to our time the inheritance of it all. Fortunately there is the original inexhaustible fund of buoyancy, normally resident in the race, forever eligible to be appeal'd to and relied on.</p>
     <p>As for native American individuality, thought certain to come, and on a large scale, the distinctive and ideal type of Western character (as consistent with the operative political and even money-making features of United States' humanity in the Nineteenth Century as chosen knights, gentlemen and warriors were the ideals of the centuries of European feudalism) it has not yet appear'd. I have allow'd the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it&#8212;not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy&#8212;and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant "the great pride of man in himself," and permit it to be more or less a <hi rend="italic">motif</hi> of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p>
     <p>Democracy has been so retarded and jeopardized by powerful personalities, that its first instincts are fain to clip, conform, bring in stragglers, and reduce everything to a dead level. While the ambitious thought of my song is to help the forming of a great aggregate Nation, it is, perhaps, altogether through the forming of myriads of fully develop'd and enclosing individuals. Welcome as are equality's and fraternity's doctrines and popular education, a certain liability accompanies them all, as we see. That primal and interior something in man, in his soul's abysms, coloring all, and , by exceptional fruitions, giving the last majesty to him&#8212;something continually touch'd upon and attain'd by the old poems and ballads of feudalism, and often the principal foundations of them&#8212;modern science and democracy appear to be endangering, perhaps eliminating. But that forms an appearance only; the reality is quite different. The new influences, upon the whole, are surely preparing the way for grander individualities than ever. To-day and here personal force is behind everything, just the same. The times and depictions from the Iliad to Shakspere inclusive can happily never again be realized&#8212;but the elements of courageous and lofty manhood are unchanged.</p>

     <p>Without yielding an inch the working-man and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which the Greek and feudal poets endow'd their god-like or lordly born characters&#8212;indeed prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those&#8212;I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and to-day, are eligible to the grandest and the best&#8212;more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances (I said to myself before beginning) to be in spirit the poems of the morning. (They have been founded an mainly written in the sunny forenoon and early midday of my life.) I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wish'd to put the complete Union of the States in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be jsut as much South as North&#8212;just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic&#8212;in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, and on the shores of Puget Sound.</p>
     <p>From another point of view "Leaves of Grass" is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality&#8212;though meanings that do not usually go along with those words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women towards the thought and fact of sexuality, as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. The vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance&#8212;like the clef of a symphony. As last analogy the lines I allude to, and the spirit in which they are spoken, permeate all "Leaves of Grass," and the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety.</p>
     <p>Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always calling in the doctor for the consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that "heroic nudity"<metamark function="link">*</metamark> on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editions of "Leaves of Grass" in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p>

Ever since what might be call'd thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ("to justify the ways of God to man" is Milton's well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, ever concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each.</p>

     enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p>
     <p>One main genesis-motive of the "Leaves" was my conviction (just as strong to-day as ever) that the crowning growth of the United States is to be spiritual and heroic. To help start and favor that growth&#8212;or even to call attention to it, or the need of it&#8212;is the beginning, middle and final purpose of the poems. (In fact, when really cipher'd out and summ'd to the last, plowing up in earnest the interminable average fallows of humanity&#8212;not "good government" merely, in the common sense&#8212;is the justification and main purpose of these United States.)</p>
     <p>Isolated advantages in any rank or grace or fortune&#8212;the direct or indirect threads of all the poetry of the past&#8212;are in my opinion distasteful to the republican genius, and offer no foundation for its fitting verse. Establish'd poems, I know, have the very great advantage of chanting the already perform'd, so full of glories, reminiscences dear to the minds of men. But my volume is a candidate for the future. "All original art," says Taine, anyhow, "is self-regulated, and no original art can be regulated from without; it carries its own counterpoise, and does not receive it from elsewhere&#8212;lives on its own blood"&#8212;a solace to my frequent bruises and sulky vanity.</p>
     <p>As the present is perhaps mainly an attempt at personal statement or illustration, I will allow myself as further help to extract the following anecdote from a book, "Annals of Old Painters," conn'd by me in youth. Rubens, the Flemish painter, in one of his wanderings through the galleries of old convents, came across a singular work. After looking at it thoughtfully for a

     <p>"Leaves of Grass" indeed (I cannot too often reiterate) has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature&#8212;an attempt, from first to last, to put <hi rend="italic">a Person</hi>, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, in America,) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me. But it is not on "Leaves of Grass" distinctively as <hi rend="italic">literature</hi>, or a specimen thereof, that I feel to dwell, or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt as such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or &#230;stheticism.

        I hope to go on record for something different&#8212;something better, if I may dare to say so.

     <p>I say no land or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own, as the land and people and circumstances of our United States need such singers and poems to-day, and for the future. Still further, as long as the States continue to absorb and be dominated by the poetry of the Old World, and remain unsupplied with autochthonous song, to express, vitalize and give color to and define their material and political success, and minister to them distinctively, so long will they stop short of first-class Nationality and remain defective.</p>

     <p>"Leaves of Grass" indeed (I cannot too often reiterate) has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature&#8212;an attempt, from first to last, to put <hi rend="italic">a Person</hi>, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, in America,) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me. But it is not on "Leaves of Grass" distinctively as <hi rend="italic">literature</hi>, or a specimen thereof, that I feel to dwell, or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt as such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or &#230;stheticism.
        <delSpan hand="#h03" rend="overstrike" spanTo="#d016"/>
        I hope to go on record for something different&#8212;something better, if I may dare to say so. If I rested "Leaves of Grass" on the usual claims&#8212;if I did not feel that the deepest moral, social, political purposes of America are the underlying endeavors at least of my pages; that the geography and hydrography of this continent, the Prairies, the St. Lawrence, Ohio, the Carolinas, Texas, Missouri are their real veins and current concrete&#8212;I should not dare to have them put in type, and printed, and offer'd for sale.

     <p>I say no land or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own, as the land and people and circumstances of our United States need such singers and poems to-day, and for the future. Still further, as long as the States continue to absorb and be dominated by the poetry of the Old World, and remain unsupplied with autochthonous song, to express, vitalize and give color to and define their material and political success, and minister to them distinctively, so long will they stop short of first-class Nationality and remain defective.</p>
     <p>In the free evening of my day I give to you, reader, the foregoing garrulous talk, thoughts, reminiscences,<lb/>
           As idly drifting down the ebb,<lb/>
           Such ripples, half-caught voices, echo from the shore.</p>
     <p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West, when it worthily rises&#8212;First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish'd and select few; Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p>

How the soul loves to float amid such reminiscences!</p>
     <p>So here I sit gossiping in the early candle-light of old age&#8212;I and my book&#8212;casting backward glances over our travel'd road. After completing, as it were, the journey&#8212;(a varied jaunt of years, with many halts and gaps of intervals&#8212;or some lengthen'd ship-voyage, wherein more than once the last hour had apparently arrived, and we seem'd certainly going down&#8212;yet reaching port in a sufficient way through all discomfitures at last)&#8212;After completing my poems, I am curious to review them in the light of their own (at the time unconscious, or mostly unconscious) intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody. These lines, therefore, will probably blend the weft of first purposes and speculations, with the warp of that experience afterwards, always bringing strange developments.</p>

S. K., Boston, May 28, f1884)&#8212;And that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special offical buffetings&#8212;is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenc'd. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions. As fulfill'd, or partially fulfill'd, the best comfort of the whole business (after a small band of the dearest friends and upholders ever vouchsafed to man or cause&#8212;doubtless all the more faithful and uncompromising&#8212;this little phalanx!&#8212;for being so few) is that, unstopp'd and unwarp'd by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record&#8212;the value thereof to be decided by time.</p>
     <p>In calculating that decision, William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke are for more peremptory than I am. Behind all else that can be said, I consider "Leaves of Grass" and its theory experimental&#8212;as, in the deepest sense, I consider our American republic itself to be, with its theory. <add hand="#h04" place="above"><metamark function="add" target="#a065"/></add><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a065">(<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a065">/</metamark></add>I think I have at least enough philosophy not to be too absolutely certain of any thing, or any results.<add hand="#h04" place="above"><metamark function="add" target="#a066"/></add><add hand="#h04" place="left" xml:id="a066">)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a066">/</metamark></add> In the second place, the volume is a <hi rend="italic">sortie</hi>&#8212;whether to prove triumphant, and conquer its field of aim and escape and construction, nothing less than a hundred years from now can fully answer.

     <p>My Book and I&#8212;what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to <subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">'6</del><add seq="2" place="above" rend="marked">'8</add></subst>0&#8212;and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be, if we have cull'd enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it in the future!</p>
     <p>Let me not dare, here or anywhere, for my own purposes, or any purposes, to attempt the definion of Poetry, not answer the question what it is. Like Religion, Love, Nature, while those terms are indispensable, and we all give a sufficiently accurate meaning to them, in my opinion no definition that has ever been made sufficiently encloses the name Poetry; nor can any rule or convention ever so absolutely obtain but some great exception my arise and disregard and overturn it.</p>
     <p>Also it must be carefully remember'd that first-class literature does not shine by any luminosity of its own; nor do its poems. They grow of circumstances, and are evolutionary. The actual living light is always curiously from elsewhere&#8212;follows unaccountable sources, and is lunar and relative at the best. There are, I know, certain controling themes that seem endlessly appropriated to the poets&#8212;as war, in the past&#8212;in the Bible, religious rapture and adoration&#8212;always love, beauty, some fine plot, or pensive or other emotion. But, strange as it may sound at first, I will say there is something striking far deeper and towering far higher than those themes for the best elements of modern song.</p>
     <p>Just as all the old imaginative works rest, after their kind, on long trains of presuppositions, often entirely unmention'd by themselves, yet supplying the most important bases of them, and without which they could have had no reason for being, so "Leaves of Grass," before a line was written, presupposed something different from any other, and, as it stands, is the result of such presupposition. I should say, indeed, it were useless to attempt reading the book without first carefully tallying that preparatory background and quality in the mind. Think of the United States to-day&#8212;the facts of these thirty-eight or forty empires solder'd in one&#8212;sixty or seventy millions of equals, with their lives, their passions, their future&#8212;these incalculable, modern, American, seething multitudes around us, of which we are inseparable parts! Think, in comparison, of the petty environage and limited area of the poets of past or present Europe, no matter how great their genius. Think of the absence and ignorance, in all cases hitherto, of the multitudinousness, vitality, and the unprecedented stimulants of to-day and here. It almost seems as if a poetry with cosmic and dynamic features of magnitude and limitlessness suitable to the human soul, were never possible before. It is certain that a poetry of absolute faith and equality for the use of the democratic masses never was.</p>
     <p>In estimating first-class song, a sufficient Nationality, or, on the other hand, what may be call'd the negative and lack of it<add hand="#h04" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a068">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a068">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a068">/</metamark></add> (as in Goethe's case, it sometimes seems to me,) is often, if not always, the first element. One needs only a little penetration to see, at more or less removes, the material facts of their country and radius, with the coloring of the moods of humanity at the time, and its gloomy or hopeful prospects, behind all poets and each poet, and forming their birth-marks. I know very well that my "Leaves" could not possibly have emerged or been fashion<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a069">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a069">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d or completed, from any other era than the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, nor any other land that democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.</p>
     <p>And whether my friends claim it for me or not, I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done, or could do. But it seem'd to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of &#230;stheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of <hi rend="italic">their point of view</hi>,<ref xml:id="r2" target="#n2"><metamark function="link">*</metamark></ref> the time had</p>

     <p>Even Shakspere, who so suffuses current letters and art (which indeed have in most degrees grown out of him,) belongs essentially to the buried past. Only he holds the proud distinction for certain important phases of that past, of being the loftiest of the singers life has yet given voice to. All, however, relate to and rest upon conditions, standards, politics, sociologies, ranges of belief, that have been quite eliminated from the Eastern hemisphere, and never existed at all in the Western. As authoritative types of song they belong in America just about as much as the persons and institutes they depict. True, it may be said, the emotional, moral, and &#230;sthetic natures of humanity have not radically changed&#8212;that in these the old poems apply to our times and all times, irrespective of date; and that they are of incalculable value as pictures of the past. I willingly make those admissions, and to their fullest extent; then advance the points herewith as of serious, even paramount importance.</p>
     <p>I have indeed put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell'd poetic bequests, and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncover'd head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written "Leaves of Grass." My verdict and conclusions as illustrated in its pages are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else&#8212;perhaps more than through anything else. As America fully and fairly construed is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the New World needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.</p>

     <p>Continuing the subject, my friends have more than once suggested&#8212;or may be the garrulity of advancing age is possessing me&#8212;some further embryonic facts of "Leaves of Grass," and especially how I enter'd upon them. Dr. Bucke has, in his volume, already fully and fairly described the preparation of my poetic field, with the particular and general plowing, planting, seeding, and occupation of the ground, till everything was fertilized, rooted, and ready to start its own way for good or bad. Not till after all this, did I attempt any serious acquaintance with poetic literature. Along in my sixteenth year I had become possessor of a stout, well-cramm'd one thousand page octavo

       <p>Later, at intervals, summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's seashores&#8212;there, in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room&#8212;it makes such difference <hi rend="italic">where</hi> you read<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a073">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a073">/</metamark></add></subst> Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante's among them.

The Iliad (Buckley's prose version<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a074">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a074">/</metamark></add></subst> I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast end of Long Island, in a shelter'd hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wonder'd since why I was not overwhelm'd by those mightly masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscape and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p>
       <p>Toward the last I had among much else look'd over Edgar Poe's poems&#8212;of which I was not an admirer, tho' I always saw that beyond their limited range of melody (like perpetual chimes of music bells, ringing from lower <hi rend="italic">d</hi> flat up to <hi rend="italic">g</hi>) they were melodious expressions, and perhaps never excell'd ones, of certain pronounc<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a075">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a075">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d phases of human morbidity. (The Poetic area is very spacious&#8212;has room for all&#8212;has so many mansions!) But I was repaid in Poe's prose by the idea that (at any rate for our occasions, our day) there can be no such thing as a long poem. The same thought had been haunting my mind before, but Poe's argument, though short, work'd the sum out and proved it to me.</p>
       <p>Another point had an early settlement, clearing the ground greatly. I saw, from the time my enterprise and questionings positively shaped themselves (how best can I express my own distinctive era and surroundings, America, Democracy?) that the trunk and centre whence the answer was to radiate, and to which all should return from straying however far a distance, must be an identical body and soul, a personality&#8212;which personality, after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself&#8212;indeed could not be any other. I also felt strongly (whether I have shown it or not) that to the true and full estimate of the Present both the Past and the Future are main considerations.</p>

        <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and little American poems&#8212;all that diligent and long-continued research could lay hands on! The author of 'Old Grimes is Dead' commenced it, more than fifty years ago; then the cluster was pass'd on and accumulated by C. F. Harris; then further pass'd on and added to by the late Senator Anthony, from whom the whole collection has been bequeath'd to Brown University. A catalogue (such as it is) has been made and publish'd of these five thousand poems&#8212;and is probably the most curious and suggestive part of the whole affair. At any rate it has led me to some abstract reflection like the following.</p>
        <p>I should like, for myself, to put on record my devout acknowledgment not only of the great masterpieces of the past, but of the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poets, past and present, and of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poetic utterance&#8212;in its entirety the dominant moral factor of humanity's progress. In view of that progress, and of evolution, the religious and &#230;sthetic elements, the distinctive and most important of any, seem to me more indebted to poetry than to all other means and influences combined. In a very profound sense <hi rend="italic">religion is the poetry of humanity</hi>. Then the points of union and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world, however wide their separations of time and place and theme, are much more numerous and weighty than the points of contrast. Without relation as they may seem at first sight, the whole earth's poets and poetry&#8212;<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>&#8212;the Oriental, the Greek, and what there is of Roman&#8212;the oldest myths&#8212;the interminable ballad-romances of the Middle Ages&#8212;the hymns and psalms of worship&#8212;the epics, plays, swarms of lyrics of the British Islands, or the Teutonic old or new&#8212;or modern French&#8212;or what there is in America, Bryant's, for instance, or Whittier's or Longfellow's&#8212;the verse of all tongues and ages, all forms, all subjects, from primitive times to our own day inclusive&#8212;really combine in one aggregate and electric globe or universe, with all its numberless parts and radiations held together by a common centre or verteber. To repeat it, all poetry thus has (to the point of view comprehensive enough) more features of resemblance than difference, and becomes essentially, like the planetary globe itself, compact and orbic and whole. Nature seems to sow countless seeds&#8212;makes incessant crude attempts&#8212;thankful to get now and then, even at rare and long intervals, something approximately good.</p>

        <head type="sub">90 THE OLD BOWERY.</head>
        <p>Doom'd" and the yet undying "Mazeppa." At one time "Jonathan Bradford, or the Murder at the Roadside Inn," had a long and crowded run; John Sefton and his brother William acted in it. I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste, a splendid pantomimist, and her emotional "Wept of the Wishton-Wish." But certainly the main "reason for being" of the Bowery Theatre those years was to furnish the public with Forrest's and Booth's performances&#8212;the latter having a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics fully equal to the former&#8212;though people were divided as always. For some reason or other, neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements at the more fashionable theatre, the Park. And it is a curious reminiscence, but a true one, that both these great actors and their performances were taboo'd by "polite society" in New York and Boston at the time&#8212;probably as being too robustuous. But no such scruples affected the Bowery.</p>
        <p>Recalling from that period the occasion of either Forrest or Booth, any good night at the old Bowery, pack'd from ceiling to pit with its audience mainly of alert, well dress'd, full-blooded young and middle-aged men, the best average of American-born mechanics&#8212;the emotional nature of the whole mass arous'd by the power and magnetism of as mighty mimes as ever trod the stage&#8212;the whole crowded auditorium, and what seeth'd in it, and flush'd from its faces and eyes, to me as much a part of the show as any&#8212;bursting forth in one of those long-kept-up tempests of hand-clapping peculiar to the Bowery&#8212;no dainty kid-glove business, but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2000 full-sinew'd men&#8212;(the inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those ovations to Edwin Forrest, welcoming him back after an absence, comes up to me this moment)&#8212;Such sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely afford to many old New Yorkers some fruitful recollections.</p>
        <p>I can yet remember (for I always scann'd an audience as rigidly as a play) the faces of the leading authors, poets, editors, of those times&#8212;Fenimore Cooper, Bryant, Paulding, Irving, Charles King, Watson Webb, N. P. Willis, Hoffman, Halleck, Mumford, Morris, Legget<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a096">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="left" rend="underline" xml:id="a096"><metamark target="#a096">(Leggett) 2</metamark>t</add>, L. G. Clarke, R. A. Locke and others, occasionally peering from the first tier boxes; and even the great National Eminences, Presidents Adams, Jackson, Van Buren and Tyler, all made short visits there on their Eastern tours.</p>
        <p>Awhile after 1840 the character of the Bowery as hitherto described completely changed.

        <head type="sub">NEW ORLEANS IN 1848. 101</head>
        <p>were given throughout by such a situation. I remember the crowds of soldiers, the gay<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d023">,</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d023">d</metamark></add> young officers, going or coming, the receipt of important news, the many discussions, the returning wounded, and so on.</p>
        <p>I remember very well seeing Gen. Taylor with his staff and other officers at the St. Charles Theatre one evening (after talking with them during the day.) There was a short play on the stage, but the principal performance was of Dr. Colyer's troupe of "Model Artists," then in the full tide of their popularity. They gave many fine groups and solo shows. The house was crowded with uniforms and shoulder-straps. Gen. T. himself, if I remember right, was almost the only officer in civilian clothes; he was a jovial, old, rather stout, plain man, with a wrinkled and dark-yellow face, and, in ways and manners, show'd the least of conventional ceremony or etiquette I ever saw; he laugh'd unrestrainedly at everything comical. (He had a great personal resemblance to Fenimore Cooper, the novelist, of New York.) I remember Gen. Pillow and quite a cluster of other militaires also present.</p>
        <p>One of my choice amusements during my stay in New Orleans was going down to the old French Market, especially of a Sunday morning. The show was a varied and curious one; among the rest, the Indian and negro hucksters with their wares. For there were always fine specimens of Indians, both men and women, young and old. I remember I nearly always on these occasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit, for my breakfast, from the immense shining copper kettle of a great Creole mulatto woman (I believe she weigh'd 230 pounds.) I never have had such coffee since. About nice drinks, anyhow, my recollection of the "cobblers" (with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers,) and also the exquisite wines, and the perfect and mild French brandy, help the regretful reminiscence of my New Orleans experiences of those days. And what splendid and roomy and leisurely bar-rooms! particularly the grand ones of the St. Charles and St. Louis. Bargains, auctions, appointments, business conferences, &amp;c., were generally held in the spaces or recesses of these bar-rooms.</p>
        <p>I used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the crowded and bustling levees, on the banks of the river. The diagonally wedg'd-in boats, the stevedores, the piles of cotton and other merchandise, the carts, mules, negroes, etc., afforded never-ending studies and sights to me. I made acquaintances among the captains, boatmen, or other characters, and often had long talks with them&#8212;sometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters. Sundays I sometimes went</p>

        <head type="sub">122 ELIAS HICKS.</head>
        <p>began to feel that the manner in which I sometimes amus'd myself with my gun was not without sin; for although I mostly preferr'd going alone, and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl, my mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations, that the opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me; yet, on other occasions, when accompanied by some of my acquaintances, and when no fowls appear'd which would be useful to us after being obtain'd, we sometimes, for wantonness or for mere diversion, would destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us. This cruel procedure affects my hears while penning these lines.</p>
        <p>In his 23d year Elias was married, by the Friends' ceremony, to Jemima Seaman. His wife was an only child; the parents were well off for common people, and at their request the son-in-law mov'd home with them and carried on the farm&#8212;which at their decease became his own, and he liv'd there all his remaining life. Of this matrimonial part of his career, (it continued, and with unusual happiness, for <hi hand="#h06" rend="underline" xml:id="j022"><subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">60</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a098">58<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a098">/</metamark></add></subst></hi><del hand="#h06" rend="overstrike"><add  hand="#h06" place="right"><metamark function="adjust" target="#j022"><unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ew">Sec &amp;</unclear> 125</metamark></add></del> years,) he says, giving the account of his marriage:</p>
        <p>On this important occasion, we felt the clear and consoling evidence of divine truth, and it remain'd with us as a seal upon our spirits, strengthening us mutually to bear, with becoming fortitude, the vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot, and of which we had a large share in passing through this probationary state. My wife, although not of a very strong constitution, liv'd to be the mother of eleven children, four sons and seven daughters. Our second daughter, a very lovely, promising child, died when young, with the small-pox, and the youngest was not living at its birth. The rest all arriv'd to years of discretion, and afforded us considerable comfort, as they prov'd to be in a good degree dutiful children. All our sons, however, were of weak constitutions, and were not able to take care of themselves, being so enfeebl'd as not to be able to walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age. The two eldest died in the fifteenth year of their age, the third in his seventeenth year, and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died. But, although thus helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the resign'd cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments, made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and pleasant; and I trust we were preserv'd from murmuring or repining, believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and according to the will and gracious disposing of an all-wise providence, for purposes best known to himself. And when I have observ'd the great anxiety and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who are favor'd with health, especially their sons, I could perceive very few whose troubles and exercises, on that account, did not far exceed ours. the weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations of the world; and we believ'd that in their death they were happy, and admitted into the realms of peace and joy: a reflection, the most comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their tender offspring.</p>
        <p>Of a serious and reflective turn, by nature, and from his reading and surroundings, Elias had more than once markedly devotional inward intimations. These feelings increas'd in frequency and strength, until soon the following:</p>

        <p>Third day. I was busied most of this day in my common vocations. Spent the evening principally in reading Paul. Found considerable satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians; in which he shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth without looking through and beyond the instrument, to the great first cause and Author of every blessing, to whom all the praise and honor are due.</p>
        <p>Fifth day, 1st of 4th month. At our meeting to-day found it, as usual, a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center'd where it ought to be. What a multitude of intruding thought imperceptibly, as it were, steal into the mind, and turn it from its proper object, whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against them. Felt a little strength, just at the close, to remind Friends of the necessity of a steady perseverance, by a recapitulation of the parable of the unjust judge, showing how men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</p>
        <p>Sixth day. Nothing material occurr'd, but a fear lest the cares of the world should engross too much of my time.</p>
        <p>Seventh day. Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends, whom I have long lov'd. The rest of the day I employ'd in manual labor, mostly in gardening.</p>
        <p>But we find if we attend to records and details, we shall lay out an endless task. We can briefly say, summarily, that his whole life was a long religious missionary life of method, practicality, sincerity, earnestness, and pure piety&#8212;as near to his time here, as one in Judea, far back&#8212;or in any life, any age. The reader who feels interested must get&#8212;with all its dryness and mere dates, absence of emotionality or literary quality, and whatever abstract attraction (with even a suspicion of cant, sniffling,) the "Journal of the Life and Religious Labours of Elias Hicks, written by himelself," at some Quaker book-store. (It is from this <hi hand="#h02" rend="circled">headquarters I have extracted <del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d024">from</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d024">d</metamark></add> the preceding</hi> quotations.) During E. H.'s matured life, continued from fifty to sixty years&#8212;while working steadily, earning his living and paying his way without intermission&#8212;he makes, as previously memorandised, several hundred preaching visits, not only through Long Islan, but some of them away into the Middle or Southern States, or north into Canada, or the then far West&#8212;extending to thousands of miles, or filling several weeks and sometimes months. These religious journeys&#8212;scrupulously accepting in payment only his transportation from place to place, with his own food and shelter, and never receiving a dollar of money for "salary" or preaching&#8212;Elias, through good bodily health and strength, continues till quite the age of eighty. It was thus at one of his latest jaunts in Brooklyn city I saw and heard him. This sight and hearing shall now be described.</p>
        <p>Elias Hicks was at this period in the latter part (November or December) of 1829. It was the last tour of the many missions</p>

A moment looking around the audience with him and the whole scene now.) Then the words come from his lips, very emphatically and slowly pronounc'd, in a resonant, grave, melodious voice, <hi rend="italic">What is the chief end of man?</hi> I was told in my early youth, <hi rend="italic">it was to glorify God, and seek and enjoy him forever.</hi></p>
        <p>I cannot follow the discourse. It presently becomes very fervid, and in the midst of its fervor he takes the broad-brim hat from his head, and almost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind, continues with uninterrupted earnestness. But, I say, I cannot repeat, hardly suggest his sermon. Though the differences and disputes of the formal division of the Society of Friends were even then under way, he did not allude to them at all. A pleading, tender, nearly agonizing conviction, and magnetic stream of natural eloquence, before which all minds and natures, all emotions, high or low, gentle or simple, yielded entirely without exception, was its cause, method, and effect. Many, very many were in tears. Years afterward in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the sailor's preacher, and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the resemblance to Elias Hicks's&#8212;not argumentative or intellectual, but so penetrating&#8212;so different from anything in the books&#8212;(different as the fresh air of a May morning or sea-shore breeze from the atmosphere of a perfumer's shop.) While he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing-song tone sometimes heard in such meetings; but in a moment or two more, as if recollecting himself, he breaks off, stops, and resumes in a natural tone. This occurs three or four times during the talk of the evening, till all concludes.</p>
        <p>Now and then, at the many scores and hundreds&#8212;even thousands&#8212;of his discourses&#8212;as at this one&#8212;he was very mystical and radical,<ref xml:id="r6" target="n6"><metamark function="link">&#967;</metamark></ref> and had much to say of "the light within." Very

The solemn composure at this time manifest in his counterance, was very impressive, indicating that he was sensible the time of his departure was at hand, and that the prospect of death brought no terrors with it. During his last illness, his mental faculties were occasionally obscured, yet he was at times enabled to give satisfactory evidence to those around him, that all was well, and that he felt nothing in his way.</p>
        <p>His funeral took place on fourth day, the 3d of 3d month. It was attended by a large concourse of Friends and others, and a solid meeting was held on the occasion; after which, his remains were interr'd in Friends' burial-ground at this place (Jericho, Queens County, New York.)</p>
        <p>I have thought (even presented so incompletely, with such fearful hiatuses, and in my own feebleness and waning life) one might well memorize this life of Elias Hicks. Though not eminent in literature or politics or inventions or business, it is a token of not a few, and is significant. Such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiers&#8212;but I have thought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a sample&#8212;that this one specially does. I have already compared it to a little flowing liquid rill of Nature's life, maintaining freshness. As if, indeed, under the smoke of battles, the blare of trumpets, and the madness of contending hosts&#8212;the screams of passion, the groans of the suffering, the parching of struggles of money and politics, and all hell's heat and noise and competition <hi rend="circle" hand="#h02">above and around</hi><add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a100">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a100">&#8212;<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a100">/</metamark></add><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="right" rend="underline">Price</note> should come melting down from the mountains from sources of unpolluted snows, far up there in God's hidden, untrodden recesses, and so rippling along among us low in the ground, at men's very feet, a curious little brook of clear and cool, and ever-healthy, ever-living water.</p>

Probably it had been preparing some time. One who was present has since described to me the climax, at a meeting of Friends in Philadelphia crowded by a great attendance of both sexes, with Elias as principal speaker. In the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these words: "The blood of Christ&#8212;the blood of Christ&#8212;why, my friends, the actual blood of Christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood of bulls and goats&#8212;not a bit more&#8212;not a bit." At these words, after a momentary hush, commenced a great tumult. Hundreds rose to their feet. . . . Canes were thump'd upon the floor. From all parts of the house angry mutterings.</p>

           <l>I sent my soul through the Invisible,</l>
           <l>Some letter of that after-life to spell,</l>
           <l>And by-and-by my soul return'd to me,</l>
           <l>And answer'd, "I myself am Heaven and Hell."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Indeed, of this important element of the theory and practice of Quakerism, the difficult-to-describe "Light within" or "Inward Law, by which all must be either justified or condemn'd," I will not undertake where so many have fail'd&#8212;the task of making the statement of it for the average comprehension. We will give, partly for the matter and partly as specimen of his speaking and writing style, what Elias Hicks himself says in allusion to it&#8212;one or two of very many passages. Most of his discourses, like those of Epictetus and the ancient peripatetics, have left no record remaining&#8212;they were extempore, and those were not the times of reporters. Of one, however deliver'd in Chester, Pa., toward the latter part of his career, there is a careful transcript; and from it (even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to be pick'd and thrash'd out several times before you get the grain,) we give the following extract:</p>
        <p>"I don't want to express a great many wor<hi hand="#h06" xml:id="j025" rend="underline">a</hi><add hand="#h06" place="right"><metamark target="#j025">?</metamark></add>s; but I want you to be call'd home to the substance. For the Scriptures, and all the books in the world, can do no more; Jesus could do no more than to recommend to this Comforter, which was the light in him. 'God is light, and in him is no darkness at all; and if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.' Because the light is one in all, and therefore it binds us together in the bonds of love; for it is not only light, but love&#8212;that love which casts out all fear. So that they who dwell in God dwell in love, and they are constrain'd to walk in it; and if they 'walk in it, they have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.'</p>
        <p>"But what blood, my friends? Did Jesus Christ, the Saviour, ever have any material blood? Not a drop of it, my friends&#8212;not a drop of it. That blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin, was the life of the soul of Jesus. The soul of man has no material blood; but as the outward material blood, created from the dust of the earth, is the life of these bodies of flesh, so with respect to the soul, the immortal and invisible spirit, its blood is that life which God breath'd into it.</p>
        <p>"As we read, in the beginning, that 'God form'd man of the dust of the ground, and breath'd into him the breath of life, and man became a living soul.' He breath'd into that soul and it became alive to God."</p>

        <p>We all know how much <hi rend="italic">mythus</hi> there is in the Shakspere question as it stands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf'd far more dim and elusive ones, of deepest importance&#8212;tantalizing and half suspected suggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point, the English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances (my maturest judgement confirming the impressions of my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the contests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we get it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism&#8212;personifying in unparallel'd ways the medi&#230;val aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)&#8212;only one of the "wolfish earls" so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works&#8212;works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.</p>
        <p>The start and germ-stock of the pieces on which the present speculation is founded are undoubtedly (with, at the outset, no small amount of bungling work) in "Henty VI." It is plain to me that as profound and forecasting a brain and pen as ever appear'd in literature, after floundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogy&#8212;or perhaps draughting it more or less experimentally <hi hand="#h06" rend="circle"><hi hand="#h02" rend="circle">or by accident&#8212;afterward develop<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a103">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a103">ed<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a103">/</metamark></add></hi> and defined his</hi><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="right">Piece</note> plan in the Second and Third Parts, and from time to time, thenceforward, systematically enlarged it to majestic and mature proportions in "Richard II," "Richard III," "King John," "Henry IV," "Henry V," and even in Macbeth," "Coriolanus" and "Lear."

        <head>ROBERT BURNS AS POET AND PERSON.</head>
        <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HAT</hi> the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works&#8212;what place will be assign'd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which can only be finish'd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries with their ample average&#8212;I of course cannot tell. But as we know him, from his recorded utterances, and after nearly one century, and its diligence of collections, songs, letters, anecdotes, presenting the figure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully complete, and the lines mainly by his own hand, he forms to-day, in some respects, the most interesting personality among singers. Then there are many things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to America. He was essentially a Republican&#8212;would have been at home in the Western United States, and probably become eminent there. He was an average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud spirited, amative, alimentive, convival, young and early-middle-aged man of the decent-born middle classes everywhere and any how. Without the race of which he is a distinct specimen, (and perhaps his poems) America and her powerful Democracy could not exist to-day&#8212;could not project with unparallel'd historic sway into the future.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first to be consider'd.

        <p>parrot-talk&#8212;not bad or deficient, but cheap, shopworn, the platitudes of old aunts and uncles to the youngsters (be good boys and keep your noses clean.) Only when he gets at Poosie Nansie's, celebrating the "barley bree," or among tramps, or democratic bouts and drinking generally,</p>
        <p>("Freedom and whiskey gang thegither,")</p>
        <p>we have, in his own unmistakable color and warmth, those interiors of rake-helly life and tavern fun&#8212;the cantabile of jolly beggars in highest jinks&#8212;lights and groupings of rank glee and brawny amorousness, outvying the best painted pictures of the Dutch school, or any school.</p>
        <p>By America and her democracy such a poet, I cannot too often repeat, must be kept in loving remembrance; but it is best that discriminations be made. His admirers (as at those anniversary suppers, over the "hot Scotch") will not accept for their favorite anything less than the highest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakspere, etc. Such, in candor, are not the true friends of the Ayrshire bard, who really needs a different place quite by himself. The Iliad and the Odyssey express courage, craft, full-grown heroism in situations of danger, the sense of command and leadership, emulation, the last and fullest evolution of self-poise as in kings, and god-like even while animal appetites. The Shaksper<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">i</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a105">e<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a105">/</metamark></add></subst><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="left"><del rend="overstrike">see p. 53</del></note>an compositions, on vertebers and framework of the primary passions, portray (essentially the same as Homer's,) the spirit and letter of the feudal world, the Normal lord, ambitious and arrogant, taller and nobler than common men&#8212;with much underplay and gusts of heat and cold, volcanoes and stormy seas. Burns (and some will say to his credit) attempts none of these themes. He poetizes the humor, riotous blood, sulks, amorous torments, fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective nature, with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his time and land, of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in Scotland, through the years and under the circumstances of the British politics of that time, and of his short personal career as author, from 1783 to 1796. He is intuitive and affectionate, and just emerged or emerging from the shackles of the kirk, from poverty, ignorance, and from his own rank appetites&#8212;(out of which latter, however, he ever extricated himself.) It is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his poems, there is in almost every piece a spark of fire, and now and then the real afflatus. He has been applauded and democratic, and with some warrant; while Shakspere, and with the greatest warrant, has been called monarchical or aristocratic (which he certainly is.) But the splendid person

        alizations of Shakspere, formulated on the largest, freest, most heroic, most artistic mould, are to me far dearer as lessons, and more precious even as models for Democracy, than the humdrum samples Burns presents. The motives of some of his effusions are certainly discreditable personally&#8212;one or two of them markedly so. He has, moreover, little or no spirituality. This last is his mortal flaw and defect, tried by highest standards. The ideal he never reach'd (and yet I think he leads the way to it.) He gives melodies, and now and then the simplest and sweetest ones; but harmonies, complications, oratorios in words, never. (I do not speak this in any deprecatory sense. Blessed by the memory of the warm-hearted Scotchman for what he has left us, just as it is!) He likewise did not know himself, in more ways than one. Though so really free and independent, he prided himself in his songs on being a reactionist and a Jacobite&#8212;on persistent sentimental adherency to the cause of the Stuarts&#8212;the weakest, thinnest, most faithless, brainless dynasty that ever held a throne.</p>
        <p>Thus, while Burns is not at all great for New World study, in the sense that Isaiah and <subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">&#230;</del><add seq="2" place="right">E</add></subst>schylus and the book of Job are unquestionably great&#8212;is not to be mention'd with Shakspere&#8212;hardly even with current Tennyson or our Emerson&#8212;he has a nestling niche of his own, all fragrant, fond, and quaint and homely&#8212;a lodge built near but outside the mighty temple of the gods of song and art&#8212;those universal strivers, through their works of harmony and melody and power, to ever show or intimate man's crowning, last, victorious fusion in himself or Real and Ideal. Precious, too&#8212;fit and precious beyond all singers, high or low&#8212;will Burns ever be to the native Scotch, especially to the working-classes of North Britain; so intensely one of them, and so racy of the soil, sights, and local customs. He often apostrophizes Scotland, and is, or would be, enthusiastically patriotic. His country has lately commemorated him in a statue.<ref target="#n7" xml:id="r7"><metamark function="link">*</metamark></ref> His aim is declaredly to be 'a Rustic Bard.'

Before the ceremony, a large procession paraded the streets of the town all the trades and societies of that part of Scotland being represented, at the head of which went dairymen and ploughmen, the former driving their carts and being accompanied by their maids. The statue is of Sicilian marble. It rests on a pedestal of gray stone five feet high. The poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree root, holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies. His face is turn'd toward the right shoulder, and the eyes gaze into the distance. Near by lie a collie dog, a broad bonnet half covering a well-thumb'd song-book, and a rustic flageolet. The costume is taken from the Nasmyth portrait, which has been follow'd for the features of the face.</note>

Surely nothing could be more apt, not only for our eminent visitors present and to come, but for home study, than the following editorial criticism of the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on Mr. Froude's visit and lectures here a few years ago, and the culminating dinner given at Delmonico's, with its brilliant array of guests:</p>
        <p>"We read the list," says the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, "of those who assembled to do honor to Mr. Froude: there were Mr. Emerson, Mr. Beecher, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Bryant; we add the names of those who sent letters of regret that they could not attend in person&#8212;Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Whittier.

The American people outside this assemblage of writers is something vaster and greater than they, singly or together, can comprehend. It cannot be said of any or all of them that they can speak for their nation. We who look on at this distance are able perhaps on that account to see the more clearly that there are qualities of the American people which find no representation, no voice, among these their spokesmen. And what is true of them is true of the English class of whom Mr. Froude my be said to be the ambassador. Mr. Froude is master of a charming style. He has the gift of grace and the gift of sympathy. Taking any single character as the subject of his study, he may succeed after a very short time in so comprehending its workings as to be able to present a living figure to the intelligence and memory of his readers. But the movements of a nation, <hi rend="italic">the voiceless purpose of a people which cannot put its own thoughts into words, yet acts upon them in each successive generation</hi>&#8212;these things do not lie within his grasp. . . . The functions of literature such as he represents are limited in their action; the influence he can wield is artificial and restricted, and, which he and his hearers please and are pleas<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a128">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a128">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d with pleasant periods, the great mass of national life will flow around them unmov<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a129">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a129">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d in its tides by action as powerless as that of the dwellers by the shore to direct the currents of the ocean."</p>

So long as such literature is no born branch and offshoot of the Nationality, rooted and grown from its roots, and fibred with its fibre, it can never answer any deep call or perennial need. Perhaps the untaught Republic is wiser than its teachers. The best literature is always a result of something far greater than itself&#8212;not the hero, but the portrait of the hero. Before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction. Beyond the old masterpieces, the Iliad, the interminable Hindu epics, the Greek tragedies, even the Bible itself, range the immense facts of what must have preceded them, their <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>&#8212;the veritable poems and masterpieces, of which<add hand="#h04" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a136">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a136">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a136">/</metamark></add> grand as they are, the word-statements are but shreds and cartoons.</p>

        <head xml:id="j030">THE BIBLE AS POETRY.</head><metamark function="adjust" target="#j030"><add hand="#h04" place="right">bigger type</add></metamark>
        <p>I suppose one cannot at this day say anything new, from a literary point of view, about those autochthonic bequests of Asia&#8212;the Hebrew Bible, the mighty Hindu epics, and a hundred lesser but typical works; (not now definitely including the Iliad&#8212;though that work was vertainly of Asiatic genesis, as Homer himself was&#8212;considerations which seem curiously ignored.) But will there ever be a time or place&#8212;ever a student, however modern, of the grand art, to whom those compositions will not afford profounder lessons than all else of there kind in the garnerage of the past? Could there be any more opportune suggestion, to the current popular writer and reader of verse, what the office of poet was in primeval times&#8212;and is yet capable of being, anew, adjusted entirely to the modern?</p>
        <p>All the poems of Orientalism, with the Old and New Testaments at the centre, tend to deep and wide, (I don't know but the deepest and widest,) psychological development&#8212;with little, or nothing at all, of the mere <subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a141">&#230;<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a141">/</metamark></add></subst>sthetic, the principal verse-requirement of our day. Very late, but unerringly, comes to every capable student the perception that it is not in beauty, it is not in art, it is not even in science, that the profoundest laws of the case have their eternal sway and outcropping.</p>
        <p>In his discourse <add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a142">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a142">on<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a142">/</metamark></add> "Hebrew Poets" De Sola Mendes said: "The fundamental feature of Judaism, of the Hebrew nationality, was religion; its poetry was naturally religious. Its subjects, God and Providence, the covenants with Israel, God in Nature, and as reveal'd, God the Creator and Governor, Nature in her majesty and beauty, inspired hymns and odes to Nature's God. And then the checker'd history of the nation furnish'd allusions, illustrations, and subjects for epic display&#8212;the glory of the sanctuary, the offerings, the splendid ritual, the Holy City, and lov'd Palestine with its pleasant v<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">s</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a143">a<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a143">/</metamark></add></subst>lleys and wild tracts." Dr. Mendes said "that rhyming was not a characteristic of Hebrew poetry at all. Metre was not a necessary mark of poetry. Great poets discarded it; the early Jewish poets knew it not."</p>
        <p>Compared with the famed epics of Greece, and lesser ones since, the spinal supports of the Bible are simple and meagre. All its history, biography, narratives, etc., are as beads, strung on and indicating the eternal thread of the Deific purpose and power. Yet with only deepest faith for impetus, and such Deific purpose for palpable or impalpable theme, it often transcends the masterpieces of Hellas, and all masterpieces. The metaphors daring beyond account, the lawless soul, extravagant by our standards, the glow of love and friendship, the ferv<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">a</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a144">e<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a144">/</metamark></add></subst>nt kiss&#8212;nothing in argument or logic, but unsurpass'd in proverbs, in religious ecstacy, in suggestions of common mortality and death, man'd great equalizers&#8212;the spirit everything, the ceremonies and forms of the churches nothing, faith limitless, its immense sensuousness immensely spiritual&#8212;an incredible, all-inclusive non-worldliness and dew-scented illiteracy (the antipodes of our Nineteenth Century business absorption and morbid refinement)&#8212;no hair-splitting doubts, no sickly sulking and sniffling, no "Hamlet," no "Adonais," no "Thanatopsis," no "In Memoriam."</p>
        <p>The culminated proof of the poetry of a country is the quality of its personnel, which, in any race, can never be really superior without superior poems. The finest blending of individuality with universality (in my opinion nothing out of the galaxies of the "Iliad," or Shakspere's heroes, or from the Tennysonian "Idyls," so lofty, devoted and starlike<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a145">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a145">/</metamark></add></subst> typified in the songs of those old Asiatic lands. Men and women as great columnar trees. Nowhere else the abnegation of self<hi hand="#h04"><anchor xml:id="j031"/></hi><add hand="#h04" place="right"><metamark function="adjust" target="#j031">#</metamark></add>towering in such quaint sublimity; nowhere else the simplest human emotions conquering the gods of heaven, and fate itself. (The episode, for instance, toward the close of the "Mahabharata"&#8212;the journey of the wife Savitri with the god of death, Yama,
        <lg>
           <l>"One terrible to see&#8212;blood-red his garb,</l>
           <l>His body huge and dark, bloodshot his eyes,</l>
           <l>Which flamed like suns beneath his turban cloth,</l>
           <l>Arm'd was he with a noose,"</l>
        </lg>
        who carries off the soul of the dead husband, the wife tenaciously following, and&#8212;by the resistless charm of perfect poetic recitation!&#8212;eventually redeeming her captive mate.)</p>
        <p>I remember how enthusiastically William H. Seward, in his last days, once expatiated on these themes, from his travels in Turkey, Egypt, and Asia Minor, finding the oldest Biblical narratives exactly illustrated there to-day with apparently no break or change along three thousand years&#8212;the veil'd women, the costumes, the gravity and simplicity, all the manners just the same. The veteran Trelawney said he found the only real <hi rend="italic">nobleman</hi> of the world in a good average specimen of the midaged or elderly Oriental. In the East the grand figure, always leading, is the <hi rend="italic">old man</hi>, majestic, with flowing beard, paternal, etc. In Europe and America, it is, as we know, the young fellow&#8212;in novels, a handsome and interesting hero, more of less juvenile&#8212;in operas, a tenor with blooming cheeks, black mustache, superficial animation, and perhaps good lungs, but no more depth than skim-milk. But reading folks probably get their information of those Bible areas and current peoples, as depicted in print by English and French cads, the most shallow, impudent, supercilious brood on earth.</p>

Hearing such men sends to the winds all the books, and formulas, and polish'd speaking, and rules of oratory.</p>
        <p>Talking of oratory, why is it that the unsophisticated practices often strike deeper than the train'd ones? Why do our experiences perhaps of some local country exhorter&#8212;or often in the West or South at political meetings&#8212;bring the most definite results?

Is not&#8212;I sometimes question&#8212;the first, last, and most important quality of all, in training for a "finish'd speaker," generally unsought, unreck'd of, both by teacher and pupil? Though maybe it cannot be taught, anyhow. At any rate, we need to clearly understand the distinction between oratory and elocution. Under the latter art, including some of high order, there is indeed no scarcity in the United States, preachers, lawyers, actors, lecturers, &amp;c. With all, there seem to be few real orators&#8212;almost none.</p>

        <p>D<hi rend="smallcap">EAR</hi> S<hi rend="smallcap">IRS</hi>:&#8212;Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the 333d Anniversary of founding Santa Fe has reach'd me so late that I have to decline, with sincere regret. But I will say a few words of hand.</p>
        <p>We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify them. They will be found ampler than has been supposed, as in widely different sources. Thus far, impress'd by New England writers and schoolmasters, we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our United States have been fashion'd from the British Islands only, and essentially form a second England only&#8212;which is a very great mistake. Many leading traits for our future national personality, and some of the best ones, will certainly prove to have originated from other than British stock. As it is, the British and German, valuable as they are in the concrete, already threaten excess. Or rather, I should say, they have certainly reach'd that excess. To-day, something outside of them, and to counterbalance them, is seriously needed.</p>
        <p>The seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States, in their present devouring relations, controlling and belittling everything else, are, in my opinion, but a vast and indispensable stage in the new world's development, and are certainly to be follow'd by something entirely different&#8212;at least by immense modifications. Character, literature, a society worthy the name, are yet to be establish'd, through a nationality of noblest spiritual, heroic and democratic attributes&#8212;not one of which at present definitely exists&#8212;entirely different from the past, though unerringly founded on it, and to justify it.</p>
        <p>To that composite American identity of the future, Spanish

           character will supply some of the most needed parts. No stock shows a grander historic retrospect&#8212;grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for patriotism, courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss utterly the illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and half Mysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the past 200 years. It is time to realize&#8212;for it is certainly true&#8212;that there will not be found any more cruelty, tyranny, superstition,&amp;c., in the <hi rend="italic">r&#233;sum&#233;</hi> of past Spanish history than in the corresponding <hi rend="italic">r&#233;sum&#233;</hi> of Anglo-Norman history. Nay, I think there will not be found so much.)</p>
        <p>Then another point, relating to American ethnology, past and to come, I will here touch upon at a venture. As to our aboriginal or Indian population&#8212;the Aztec in the South, and many a tribe in the North and West&#8212;I know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on, and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence, a blank. But I am not at all clear about that. As America, from its many far-back sources and current supplies, develops, adapts, entwines, faithfully identifies its own&#8212;are we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside globe&#8212;and then rejecting the only ones distinctively its own&#8212;the autochthonic ones?</p>
        <p>As to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we do not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element. Who knows but that element, like the course of some subterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years, is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?</p>
        <p>If I might assume to do so, I would like to send you the most cordial, heartfelt congratulations of your American fellow-countrymen here. You have more friends in the Northern and Atlantic<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a149">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a149"><metamark function="emphasize">#</metamark></add>regions than you suppose, and they are deeply interested in the development of the great Southwestern interior, and in what your festival would arouse to the public attention.</p>

        <head>WHAT LURKS BEHIND SHAKSPERE'S HISTORICAL PLAYS?</head>
        <p>We all know how much <hi rend="italic">mythus</hi> there is in the Shakspere question as it stands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf'd far more dim and elusive ones, of deepest importance&#8212;tantalizing and half suspected&#8212;suggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point, the English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances (my maturest judgment confirming the impressions of my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the contests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we get it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism&#8212;personifying in unparallel'd ways the medi&#230;val aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)&#8212;only one of the "wolfish earls" so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works&#8212;works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.</p>

        <p>All the foregoing to premise a brief statement of how and where I get my new light on Shakspere. Speaking of the special English plays, my friend William O'Connor says:</p>
        <p>They seem simply and rudely historical in their motive, as aiming to give in the rough a tableau of warring dynasties,&#8212;and carry to me a lurking sense of being in aid of some ulterior design, probably well enough understood in that age, which perhaps time and criticism will reveal. . . . . Their atmosphere is one of barbarous and tumultuous gloom,&#8212;they do not make us love the times they limn, . . . . and it is impossible to believe that the greatest of the Elizabethan men could have sought to indoctrinate the age with the love of feudalism which his own drama in its entirety, if the view taken of it herein be true, certainly and subtly saps and mines.</p>
        <p>Reading the just-specified play in the light of Mr. O'Conn<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a151">o<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a151">/</metamark></add></subst>r's suggestion, I defy any one to escape such new and deep utterance-meanings, like magic ink, warm<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a152">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a152">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d by the fire, and previously invisible.

        <p>The summary of my suggestion would be, therefore, that while the more the rich and tangled jungle of the Shaksperean area is travers<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a154">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a154">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d and studied, and the more baffled and mix<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a155">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a155">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d, as so far appears, becomes the exploring student (who at last surmises everything, and remains certain of nothing<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a156">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a156">/</metamark></add></subst> it is possible a future age of criticism, diving deeper, mapping the land and lines freer, completer than hitherto, may discover in the plays named the scientific (Baconian?) inauguration of modern Democracy&#8212;furnishing realistic and first-class artistic portraitures of the <hi rend="underline" hand="#h02">medi&#230;val</hi> world, the feudal personalities, institutes, in their morbid accumulations, deposits, upon politics and sociology,&#8212;my penetrate to that hard-pan, far down and back of the ostent of to-day, on which (and on which only) the progressism of the last two centuries has built this Democracy which now holds secure lodgment over the whole civilized world.</p>
        <p>Whether such was the unconscious, or (as I think likely) the more or less conscious, purpose of him who fashion'd those marvellous architectonics, is a secondary question.</p>

           <p>like a fine, aristocratic perfume, holding a touch of musk (Euphues, his mark)&#8212;with boundless sumptuousness and adornment, real velvet and gems, not shoddy nor paste&#8212;but a good deal of bombast and fustian&#8212;(certainly some terrific mouthing in Shakespere!)</p>
           <p>Superb and inimitable as all is, it is mostly an objective and physiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in Shakspere&#8212;a style supremely grand of the sort, but in my opinion stopping short of the grandest sort, at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern and scientific and democratic American purposes. Think, not of growths and forests primeval, or Yellowstone geysers, or Colorado ravines, but of costly marble palaces, and palace rooms, and the noblest fixings and furniture, and noble owners and occupants to correspond&#8212;think of carefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening art at its best, with walks and bowers and artificial lakes, and appropriate statue-groups and the finest cultivated roses and lilies and japonicas in plenty&#8212;and you have the tally of Shakspere. The low characters, mechanics, even the loyal henchmen&#8212;all in themselves nothing&#8212;serve us capital foils to the aristocracy. The comedies (exquisite as they certainly are) bringing in admirably portray'd common characters, have the unmistakable hue of plays, portraits, made for the divertisement only of the &#233;lite of the castle, and from its point of view. The comedies are altogether non-acceptable to America and Democracy.</p>
           <note type="authorial" hand="#h02" place="right" rend="circled"><del rend="overstrike">3</del></note>
           <p>But to the deepest soul, it seems a shame to pick and choose from the riches Shakspere has left us&#8212;to criticise his infinitely royal, multiform quality&#8212;to gauge, with optic glasses, the dazzle of his sun-like beams.</p>
           <p>The best poetic utterance, after all, can merely hint, or remind, often very indirectly, or at distant removes. Aught of real perfection, or the solution of any deep problem, or any completed statement of the moral, the true, the beautiful, eludes the greatest, deftest poet&#8212;flies away like an always uncaught bird.</p>

Then however precious to "culture," the grandest of those poems, it may be said, preserve and typify results offensive to the modern spirit, and long past away. To state it briefly, and taking the strongest examples, in Homer lives the ruthless military prowess of Greece, and of its special god-descended dynastic houses; in Shakspere the dragon-rancors and stormy feudal splendor of medi&#230;val caste.</p>
        <p>Poetry, largely consider'd, is an evolution, sending out improved and ever-expanded types&#8212;in one sense, the past, even the best of it, necessarily giving place, and dying out. For our existing world, the bases on which all the grand old poems were built have become vacuums&#8212;and even those of many comparatively modern ones are broken and half-gone. For us to-day, not their own intrinsic value, vast as that is, backs and maintains those poems&#8212;but a mountain-high growth of associations, the layers of successive ages. Everywhere&#8212;their own lands included&#8212;(is there not something terrible in the tenacity with which the one book out of millions holds its grip?)&#8212;the Homeric and Virgilian works, the interminable ballad-romances of the middle ages, the utterances of Dante, Spenser, and others, are upheld by their cumulus entrenchment in scholarship, and as precious, always welcome, unspeakably valuable reminiscences.</p>
        <p>Even the one who at present reigns unquestion'd&#8212;of Shakspere&#8212;for all he stands for so much in modern literature, he stands entirely for the mighty &#230;sthetic sceptres of the past, not for the spiritual and democratic, the sceptres of the future. The inward and outward characteristics of Shakspere are his vast and rich variety of persons and themes, with his wondrous delineation of each and all&#8212;not only limitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource, but great excess, superf&#630;tation&#8212;mannerism,</p>

        <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HAT</hi> the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works&#8212;what place will be assign'd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which can only be finish'd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries with their ample average&#8212;I of course cannot tell. But as we know him, from his recorded utterances, and after nearly one century, and its diligence of collections, songs, letters, anecdotes, presenting the figure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully complete, and the lines mainly by his own hand, he forms to-day, in some respects, the most interesting personality among singers. Then there are many things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to America. He was essentially a Republican&#8212;would have been at home in the Western United States, and probably become eminent there. He was an average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud-spirited, amative, alimentive, convivial, young and early-middle-aged man of the decent-born middle classes everywhere and any how. Without the race of which he is a distinct specimen, (and perhaps his poems) America and her powerful Democracy could not exist to-day&#8212;could not project with unparallel'd historic sway into the future.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first to be consider'd. It included the times of the '76&#8211;'83 Revolution in America, of the French Revolution, and an unparallel'd chaos<del hand="#h04" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d037"><gap reason="illegible" extent="one character"/></del><add hand="#h04" place="left"><metamark function="delete" target="#d037">d</metamark></add>developement in Europe and elsewhere. In every department, shining and strange names, like stars, some rising, some in meridian, some declining&#8212;Voltaire, Franklin, Washington, Kant, Goethe, Fulton, Napoleon, mark the era. And while so much, and of grandest moment, fit for the trumpet of the world's fame, was being transacted&#8212;that little tragi-comedy of R. B.'s life and death was going on in a country by-place in Scotland!</p>
        <p>Burns's correspondence, generally collected and publish'd since his death, gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak (and worse than weak) parts of his portraiture, habits, good and bad luck, ambition and associations. His letters to Mrs. Dunlop, Mrs. McLehose, (Clarinda,) Mr. Thompson, Dr. Moore, Robert Muir, Mr. Cunningham, Miss Margaret Chalmers, Peter Hill, Richard Brown, Mrs. Riddel, Robert Ainslie, and Robert Graham, afford valuable lights and shades to the outline, and with numerous others, help to a touch here, and fill-in there, of poet and poems. There are suspicions, it is true, of "the Genteel Letter-Writer," with scraps and words from "the Manual of French Quotations," and, in the love-letters, some hollow mouthings. Yet we wouldn't on any account lack the letters. A full and true portrait is always what is wanted; veracity at every hazard. Besides, do we not all see by this time that the story of Burns, even for its own sake, requires the record of the whole and several, with nothing left out? Completely and every point minutely told out its fullest, explains and justifies itself&#8212;(as perhaps almost any life does<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">).</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a161">.)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a161">/</metamark></add></subst> He is very close to the earth. He pick'd up his best words and tunes directly from the Scotch home-singers, but tells Thomson they would not please his, <subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">T.'<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">,</del><add seq="1" place="right" xml:id="a162">s,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a162">/</metamark></add></subst></del><add seq="2" place="right">T's,</add></subst> "learn'd lugs," adding, "I call them simple&#8212;you would pronounce them silly." Yes, indeed; the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit. Yet Dr. Moore, in 1789, writes to Burns, "If I were to offer an opinion, it would be that in your future productions you should abandon the Scotch stanza and dialect, and adopt the measure and language of modern English poetry<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">!"</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a163">"!<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a163">/</metamark></add></subst></p>
        <p>As the 128th birth-anniversary of the poet draws on, (January, 1887<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a164">,)<metamark function="emphsize" target="#a164">/</metamark></add></subst> with its increasing club-suppers, vehement celebrations, letters, speeches, and so on&#8212;(mostly, as William O'Connor says, from people who would not have noticed R.B. at all during his actual life, nor kept his company, or read his verses, on any account)&#8212;it may be opportune to print some leisurely-jotted notes I find in my budget. I take my observation of the Scottish bard by considering him as an individual amid the crowded clusters, galaxies, of the old world&#8212;and fairly inquiring and suggesting what out of these myriads he too may be to the Western Republic. In the first place no poet on record so fully bequeaths his own personal magnetism,<ref xml:id="r8" target="#n8"><metamark function="link">*</metamark></ref><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a165"><metamark function="emphasize" target="#a165">/</metamark>mind the note &#9757;</add> nor illustrates more pointedly how one's verses, by time and reading, can so curiously fuse with the versifier's own life and death, and give final light and shade to all.</p>
        <p>I would say a large part of the fascination of Burns's homely, simple dialect-melodies is due, for all current and future readers, to the poet's personal "errors," the general bleakness of his lot, his ingrain'd pensiveness, his brief dash into dazzling, tantalizing, evanescent sunshine&#8212;finally culminating in those last years of his life, his being taboo'd and in debt, sick and sore, yaw'd as by contending gales, deeply dissatisfied with everything, most of all with himself&#8212;high-spirited too&#8212;(no man ever really higher-spirited than Robert Burns). I think it a perfectly legitimate part too. At any rate it has come to be an impalpable aroma through which only both the songs and their singer must henceforth be read and absorb'd. Through that view-medium of misfortune&#8212;of a noble spirit in low environments, and of a squalid and premature death&#8212;we view the undoubted facts, (giving, as we read them now, a sad kind of pungency,) that Burns's were, before all else, the lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication. Perhaps even it is this strange, impalpable

If he had lived steady, fat, moral, comfortable, well-to-do years, on his own grade, (let alone, what of course was out of the question, the ease and velvet and rosewood and copious royalties of Tennyson or Victor Hugo or Longfellow,) and died well-ripen'd and respectable, where could have come in that burst of passionate sobbing and remorse which well'd forth instantly and generally in Scotland, and soon follow'd everywhere among English-speaking races, on the announcement of his death? and which, with no sign of stopping, only regulated and vein'd with fitting appreciation, flows deeply, widely yet?</p>

The reason is not hard to find: he has a real heart of flesh and blood beating in his bosom; you could almost hear it throb. "Some one said, that if you had shaken hands with him his hand would have burnt yours. The gods, indeed, made him poetical, but Nature had a hand in him first. His heart was in the right place; he did not pile up cantos of poetic diction; he pluck'd the mountain daisy under his feet; he wrote of field-mouse hurrying from its ruin'd dwelling. He held the plough or the pen with the same firs, manly grasp.<del hand="#h04" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d038">'</del><add hand="#h04" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d038">d</metamark></add> And he was loved. The simple roll of the women who gave him their affection and their sympathy would make a long manuscript; and most of these were of such noble worth that, as Robert Chambers says, 'their character may stand as a testimony in favor of that of Burns.'" [As I understand, the foregoing is from an extremely rare book publish'd by M'Kie, in Kilmarnock. I find the whole beautiful paragraph in a captial paper on Burns, by Amelia Barr.]</note>

I think, indeed, one best part of Burns is the unquestionable proof he presents of the perennial existence among the laboring classes, especially farmers, of the finest latent poetic elements in their blood<hi hand="#h06" rend="overstrike" xml:id="j037">.</hi><add hand="#h06" place="right"><metamark function="adjust" target="#j037">&#2537;</metamark></add> (How clear it is to me that the common soil has always been, and is now, thickly strewn with just such gems.) He is well-called the <hi rend="italic">Ploughman</hi> "Holding the plough," said his brother Gilbert, "was the favorite situation with Robert for poetic compositions; and some of his best verses were produced while he was at that exercise." "I must return to my humble station, and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way, at the plough-tail."&#8212;17<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">7</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a167">8<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a167">/</metamark></add></subst>7, to the Earl of Buchan. He has no high ideal of the poet or the poet's office; indeed quite a low and contracted notion of both:</p>
        <lg>
           <l>"Fortune! if thou'll but gie me still</l>
           <l>Hale breeks, a scone, and whiskey gill,</l>
           <l>An' rowth o' rhyme to rave at will,<lb/>
              Tak' a' the rest."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>See also his rhym'd letters to Robert Graham invoking patronage; "one stronghold," Lord Glencairn, being dead, now these appeals to "Fintra, my other stay," (with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation generally.) In his collected poems there is no particular unity, nothing that can be called a leading theory, no unmistakable spin or skeleton. Perhaps, indeed, their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs: "I take up one or another," he says in a letter to Thompson, "just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug."</p>
        <p>Consonantly with the customs of the time&#8212;yet markedly inconsistent in spirit with Burns's own case, (and not a little painful as it remains on record, as depicting some features of the bard himself,) the relation called <hi rend="italic">patronage</hi> existed between the nobility and gentry on one side, and literary people on the other, and gives one of the strongest side-lights to the general coloring of poems and poets. It crops out a good deal in Burns's Letters, and even necessitated a certain flunkeyism on occasions, through life. It probably, with its requirements, (while it help'd in money and countenance) did as much as any one cause in making that life a chafed and unhappy one, ended by a premature and miserable death.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is something about Burns peculiarly acceptable to the concrete, human points of view. He poetizes work-a-day

        <p>By America and her democracy such a poet, I cannot too often repeat, must be kept in loving remembrance; but it is best that discriminations be made. His admirers (as at those anniversary suppers, over the "hot Scotch") will not accept for their favorite anything less than the highest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakspere, etc. Such, in candor, are not the true friends of the Ayrshire bard, who really needs a different place quite by himself. The Iliad and the Odyssey express courage, cragt, full-grown heroism in situations of danger, the sense of command and leadership, emulation, the last and fullest evolution of self-poise as in kinds, and god-like even while animal appetites. The Shaksperian compositions, on vertebers and framework of the primary passions, portray (essentially the same as Homer's,) the spirit and letter of the feudal world, the Norman lord, ambitious and arrogant, taller and nobler than common men&#8212;with much underplay and gusts of heat and cold, volcanoes and stormy seas. Burns (and some will say to his credit) attempts none of these themes. He poetizes the humor, riotous blood, sulks, amorous torments, fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective nature, with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his time and land, of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in Scotland, through the years and under the circumstances of the British politics of that time, and of his short personal career as author, form 1783 to 1796. He is intutive and affectionate, and just emerged or emerging from the shackles of the kirk, from poverty, ignorance, and from his own rank appetites&#8212;(out of which latter, however, he never extricated himself.) It is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his poems, there is in almost every piece a spark of fire, and now and then the real afflatus. He has been applauded as democratic, and with some warrant; while Shakspere, and with the greatest warrant, has been called monarchical or aristocratic (which he certainly is.) But the splendid personalizations of Shakspere, formulated on the largest, freest, most heroic, most artistic mould, are to me far dearer as lessons, and more precious even as models for Democracy, than the humdrum samples Burns presents. The motives of some of his effusions are certainly discreditable personally&#8212;one or two of them markedly so. He has, moreover, little or no spirituality. This last is his mortal flaw and defect, tried by highest standards. The ideal he never reach'd (and yet I think he leads the way to it.) He gives melodies, and now and then the simplest and sweetest ones; but harmonies, complications, oratorios in words, never. (I do no speak this in any deprecatory sense. Blessed be the memory of the warm-hearted Scotchman for what he has left us, just as it is!) He likewise did not know himself, in more ways than one. Though so really free and independent, he prided himself in his songs on being a reactionist and a Jacobite&#8212;on persistent sentimental adherency to the cause of the Stuarts&#8212;the weakest, thinnest, most faithless, brainless dynasty that ever held a throne.</p>

The statue is of Sicilian marble. It rests on a pedestal of gray stone five feet high. The poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree root, holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies. His face is turn'd toward the right shoulder, and the eyes gaze into the distance. Near by lie a collie dog, a broad bonnet half covering a well-thumb'd song-book, and a rustic flageolet.

His brightest hit is his use of the Scotch patois, so full of terms flavor'd like wild fruits or berries. Then I should make an allowance to Burns which cannot be made for any other poet. Curiously even the frequent crudeness, haste, deficiencies, (flatness and puerilities by no means absent) prove upon the whole not out of keeping in any comprehensive collection of his works, heroically printed, 'following copy,' every piece, every line according to originals.

        <p>The longer and more elaborated poems of Burns are just such as would please a natural but homely taste, and cute but ave<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">ar</del><add hand="#h02" place="right">ra</add></subst>ge intellect, and are inimitable in their way. The "Twa Dogs," (one of the best) with the conversation between Cesar and Luath, the "Brigs of Ayr," "the Cotter's Saturday Night," "Tam O'Shanter"&#8212;all will be long read and re-read and admired, and ever deserve to be. With nothing profound in any of them, what there is of moral and plot has an inimitably fresh and racy flavor. If it came to question, Literature could well afford to send adrift many a pretensive poem, and even book of poems, before it could spare these compositions.</p>
        <p>Never indeed was there truer utterance in a certain range of idiosyncracy than by this poet. Hardly a piece of his, large or small, but has "snap" and raciness. He puts in cantering rhyme (often doggerel) much cutting irony and idiomatic ear-cuffing of the kirk-deacons&#8212;drily good-natured addresses to his cronies, (he certainly would not stop us if he were here this moment, from classing that "to the De'il" among them)&#8212;"to Mailie and her Lambs," "to auld Mare Maggie," "to a Mouse,"

From such deep-down elements sprout up, in very contrast and paradox, those riant utterances of which a superficial reading will not detect the hidden foundation. Yet nothing is clearer to me than the black and desperate background behind those pieces&#8212;as

Then the simile of my friend John Burroughs is entirely true, 'his glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a royal laureate, quite elegant and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own&#8212;different, and yet with a sort of home-likeness&#8212;a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all our own.</p>
        <p>To me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a warning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism.

        <p>Yes, Alfred Tennyson's is a superb character, and will help give illustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our Nineteenth Century. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation of stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts, swervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are like the voyagers of a ship, casting off for new seas, distant shores. We would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once impell<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a186">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a186">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our fathers stay<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a187">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a187">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d, and live as they lived.</p>
        <p>May-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human, and pay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize that here is a great and ardent Nation that absorbs his songs, and has a respect and affection for him personally, as almost for no other foreigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth; and that truth (a little Christmas gift) no slight one either. I have written impromptu, and shall let it all go at that. The readers of more than fifty millions of people in the New World not only owe to him some of their most agreeable and harmless and healthy hours, but he has enter<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a188">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a188">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d into the formative influences of character here, not only in the Atlantic cities, but inland and far West, out in Missouri, in Kansas, and away in Oregon, in farmer's house and miner's cabin.</p>

His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the upper-crust of his time, its pale cast of thought&#8212;even its <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>. Then the simile of my friend John Burroughs is entirely true, 'his glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a royal laureate, quite elegant and 'aristocratic,<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">"</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a189">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a189">/</metamark></add></subst> and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own&#8212;different, and yet with a sort of home-likeness&#8212;a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all our own.</p>
        <p>To me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a warning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism. There is such a latent charm in mere words, cunning coll<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">u</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a190">o<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a190">/</metamark></add></subst>cutions, and in the voice ringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all others&#8212;as in the line,
           <l>And hollow, hollow, hollow, all delight,</l>
           in 'The Passing of Arthur,' and evidenced in 'The Lady of Shalott,' 'The Deserted House,' and many other pieces. Among the best (I often linger over them again and again) are 'Lucretius,' 'The Lotos Eaters,' and 'The Northern Farmer.' His mannerism is great, but it is a noble and welcome mannerism. His very best work, to me, is contain<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a191">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a191">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d in the books of 'The Idyls of the King,' and all that has grown out of them. Though indeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson, however small or however peculiar&#8212;not 'Break, Break,' nor 'Flower in the Crannied Wall' nor the old, eternally-told passion of 'Edward Gray:'
           <lg>

              <l rend="indented1">And fly like a bird from tree to tree</l>

        <p>Yes, Alfred Tennyson's is a superb character, and will help give illustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our Nineteenth Century. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation of stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts, swervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are like the voyagers of a ship, casting off for new seas, distant shores. We would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once impell'd to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our fathers stay'd, and live as they lived.</p>

        <p>The Western States of the Union are, however, as may be supposed, the special areas of slang, not only in conversation, but in names of localities, towns, rivers, etc. A late Oregon traveller says:</p>

                 <p>"On your way to Olympia by rail, you cross a river called the Shookum-Chuck; your train stops at places named Newaukum, Tumwater, and Toutle; and if you seek further you will hear of whole counties labell'd Wahkiahum, or Snohomish, or Kitsar, or Klikatat; and Cowlitz, Hookium, and Nenolelops greet and offend you. They complain in Olympia that Washington Territory gets but little immigration; but what wonder? What man, having the whole American continent to choose from, would willingly date his letters from the county of Snohomish or bring up his children in the city of Nenolelops? The village of Tumwater is, as I am ready to bear witness, very pretty iindeed; but surely an emigrant would think twice before he establish'd himself either there or at Toutle. Seattle is sufficiently barbarous; Stelicoom is no better; and I suspect that the Norther Pacific Railroad terminus has been fixed at Tacoma because it is one of the few places on Puget Sound whose name does not inspire horror.'"</p>

        <p>The science of language has large and close analogies in geological science, with its ceaseless evolution, its fossils, and its numberless submerged layers and hidden strata, the infinite go before of the present. Or, perhaps Language is more like some vast living body, or perennial body of bodies. And slang not only brings the first feeders of it, but is afterward the start of fancy, imagination and humor, breathing into its nostrils the breath of life.</p>

        <p>May-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human, and pay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize that here is a great and ardent Nation that absorbs his songs, and has a respect and affection for him personally, as almost for no other foreigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth; and that truth (a little Christmas gift) no slight one either. I have written impromptu, and shall let it all go at that. The readers of more than fifty millions of people in the New World not only owe to him some of their most agreeable and harmless and healthy hours, but he has enter'd into the formative influences of character here, not only in the Atlantic cities, but inland and far West, out in Missouri, in Kansas, and away in Oregon, in farmer's house and miner's cabin.</p>
        <p>Best thanks, anyhow, to Alfred Tennyson&#8212;thanks and appreciation in America's name.</p>

At any rate it has led me to some abstract reflections like the following.</p>
        <p>I should like, for myself, to put on record my devout acknowledgment not only of the great masterpieces of the past, but of the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poets, past and present, and of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poetic utterance&#8212;in its entirety the dominant moral factor of humanity's progress. In view of that progress and of evolution, the religious and &#230;sthetic elements, the distinctive and most important of any, seem to me more indebted to poetry than to all other means and influences combined. In a very profound sense <hi hand="#h04" rend="underline" xml:id="j046">religion <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the poetry of humanity.</hi><add hand="#h04" place="right" rend="circle"><metamark function="adjust" target="#j046">ital all</metamark></add> Then the points of union and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world, however wide their separations of time and place and theme, are much more numerous and weighty than the points of contrast. Without relation as they may seem at first sight, the whole earth's poets and poetry&#8212;<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>&#8212;the Oriental, the Greek, and what there is of Roman&#8212;the oldest myths&#8212;the interminable ballad-romances of the Middle Ages&#8212;the hymns and psalms of worship&#8212;the epics, plays, swarms of lyrics of the British Islands, or the Teutonic old or new&#8212;or modern French&#8212;or what there is in America, Bryant's, for instance, or Whittier's or Longfellow's&#8212;the verse of all tongues and ages, all forms, all subjects<add hand="#h04" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a201">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h04" place="left" xml:id="a201">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a201">/</metamark></add> from primitive times to our own day inclusive&#8212;really combine in one aggregate and electric globe or universe, with all its numberless parts and radiations<del hand="#h04" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d046">,</del><add hand="#h04" place="left"><metamark function="delete" target="#d046">d</metamark></add> held together by a common centre or verteber. To repeat it, all poetry thus has (to the point of view comprehensive enough) more features of resemblance than difference, and becomes essentially, like the planetary globe itself, compact and orbic and whole. Even science has sometimes to vail or bow her majestic head to her imaginative sister. That there should be a good deal of wast land and many sterile spots is doubtless an inherent necessity of the case&#8212;perhaps that the greater part of the rondure should be waste (at least until brought out, discover<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a202">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a202">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d). Nature seems to sow countless seeds&#8212;makes incessant crude attempts&#8212;thankful to get now and then, even at rare and long intervals, something approximately good.</p>

I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste, a splendid pantomimist, and her emotional "Wept of the Wishton-Wish." But certainly the main "reason for being" of the Bowery Theatre those years was to furnish the public with Forrest's and Booth's performances&#8212;the latter having a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics fully equal to the former&#8212;though people were divided as always. For some reason or other, neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements at the more fashionable theatre, the Park. And it is a curious reminiscence, but a true one, that both these great actors and their performances were taboo'd by "polite society" in New York and Boston at the time&#8212;probably as being too robust<subst hand="#h09"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">i</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a203">u<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a203">/</metamark></add></subst><add hand="#h09" place="right" rend="circle">robustuous</add>ous.

        <p>I can yet remember (for I always scann'd an audience as rigidly as a play) the faces of the leading authors, poets, editors, of those times&#8212;Fenimore Cooper, Bryant, Paulding, Irving, Charles King, Watson Webb, N. P. Willis, Hoffman, Halleck, Mumford, Morris, Legget, L. G. Clarke, R. A. Locke and others, occasionally peering from the first tier boxes; and even the great National Eminences, Presidents Adams, Jackson, Van Buren and Tyler, all made short visits there on their Eastern tours.</p>
        <p>Awhile after 1840 the character of the Bowery as hitherto described completely changed. Cheap prices and vulgar programmes came in. People who of after years saw the pandemonium of the pit and the doings on the boards must not g<subst hand="#h06"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">ua</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a205">au<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a205">/</metamark></add></subst>ge by them the times and characters I am describing. Not but what there was more or less rankness in the crowd even them. For types of sectional New York those days&#8212;the streets East of the Bowery, that intersect Division, Grand, and up to Third Avenue&#8212;types that never found their Dickens, or Hogarth, or Balzac, and have pass'd away unportraitured&#8212;the young ship-builders, cartmen, butchers, firemen (the old-time "soap-lock" or exaggerated "Mose" or "Sik<hi hand="#h06" rend="underline">ese</hi>y," of Chanf<subst hand="#h06"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">ar</del><add seq="2" place="right">ra</add></subst>u's plays<subst hand="#h09"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a206">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a206">/</metamark></add></subst> they, too, were always to be seen in thses audiences, racy of the East River and the Dry Dock.

Yet there never were audiences that paid a good actor or an interesting play the compliment of more sustain'd attention or quicker rapport. Then at times came the exceptionally decorous and intellectual congregations i have hinted at; for the Bowery really furnish'd plays and players you could get nowhere else. Notably, Booth always drew the best hearers; and to a specimen of his acting I will now attend in some detail.</p>
        <note hand="#h06" place="right">Gray</note>
        <p>I happen'd to see what has been reckon'd by experts one of the most marvelous pieces of histrionism ever known. It must have been about 1834 or '35. A favorite comedian and actress at the Bowery, Thomas Flynn and his wife, were to have a joint benefit, and, securing Booth for Richard, advertised the fact many days before-hand. The house fill'd early from top to bottom. There was some uneasiness behind the scenes, for the afternoon arrived<add hand="#h09" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a208">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h09" place="right" xml:id="a208">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a208">/</metamark></add> and Booth had not come from down in Maryland, where he lived. However, a few minutes before ringing-up time he made his appearance in lively condition.</p>

        <p>After a one-act farce is over, as contrast and prelude, the curtain rises for the tragedy, I can, from my good seat in the pit, pretty well front, see again Booth's quiet entrance from the side, as, with head bent, he slowly and in silence, (amid the tempest of boisterous hand-clapping<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d048">s</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d048">d</metamark></add>) walks down the stage to the foot-lights with that peculiar and abstracted gesture, musingly kicking his sword, which he holds off from him by its sash. Though fifty years have pass'd since then, I can hear the clank and feel the perfect following hush of perhaps three thousand people waiting. (I never saw an actor who could make more of the said hush or wait, and hold the audience in an indescribable, half-delicious, half-irritating suspense.) And so throughout the entire play, all parts, voice, atmosphere, magnetism, from
        <l>"Now is the winter of our discontent,"</l>
        to the closing death fight with Richmond, were of the finest and grandest. The latter character was played by a stalwart young fellow named Ingersoll. Indeed, all the renderings were wonderfully good. But the great spell cast upon the mass of hearers came from Booth. Especially was the dream scene very impressive. A shudder went through every nervous system in the audience; it certainly did through mine.</p>
        <p>Without questions Booth was royal heir and legitimate representative of the Garrick-Kemble-Siddons dramatic traditions; but he vitalized and gave an unnamable <hi rend="italic">race</hi> to those traditions with his own electric personal idiosyncrasy. (As in all art-utterance it was the subtle and powerful something <hi rend="italic">special to the individual</hi> that really conquer'd.)</p>
        <p>To me, too, Booth stands for much else besides theatricals. I consider that my seeing the man those years glimps'd for me, beyond all else, that inner spirit and form&#8212;the unquestionable charm and vivacity, but intrinsic sophistication and artificiality&#8212;crystallizing rapidly upon the English stage and literature at and after Shakspere's time, and coming on accumulatively through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the beginning, fifty or forty years ago, of those disintegrating, decomposing processes now authoritatively going on. Yes; although Booth must be class'd in that antique, almost extinct school, inflated, stagy, rendering Shakspere (perhaps inevitably, appropriately) from the growth of arbitrary and often cockney conventions, his genius was to me one of the grandest revelations of my life, a lesson of artistic expression. The words fire, energy, <hi rend="italic">abandon</hi>, found in his unprecedented meanings. I never heard a speaker or actor who could give such a sting to hauteur or the taunt. I never heard from any other the charm of unswervingly perfect vocalization without trenching at all on mere melody, the province of music.</p>
        <p>So much for a Thespian temple of New York fifty years since, where "sceptred tragedy went trailing by" under the gaze of the Dry Dock youth, and both players and auditors were of a character and like we shall never see again. And so much for the grandest histrion of modern times, as near I can deliberately judge (and the phrenologists put my "caution <del hand="#h04" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d049"><unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ew">on</unclear></del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d049">d</metamark></add>" at 7)&#8212;grander, I believe, than Kean in the expression of electric passion, the prime eligibility of the tragic artist. For though those brilliant years had many fine and even magnificent actors, undoubtedly at Booth's death (in 1852) went the last and by far the noblest Roman of them all.</p>

Everything I heard about him authentically, and every time I saw him (and it was my fortune through 1862 to '65 to see, or pass a word with, or watch him, personally, perhaps twenty or thirty times<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a216">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a216">/</metamark></add></subst> added to and anneal'd my respect and love at the moment. And as I dwell on what I myself heard or saw of the mighty Westerner, and blend it with the history and literature of my age, and of what I can get of all ages, and conclude it with his death, it seems like some tragic play, superior to all else I know&#8212;vaster and fierier and more convulsionary, for this America of ours, than Eschylus or Shakspe<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d055"><hi hand="#h02" rend="underline">a</hi></del><add hand="#h02" place="left"><metamark function="delete" target="#d055">d</metamark></add>re ever drew for Athens or for England.

        <p>Abraham Lincoln's was really one of those characters, the best of which is the result of long trains of cause and effect&#8212;needing a certain spaciousness of time, and perhaps even remoteness, to properly enclose them&#8212;having unequal'd influence on the shaping of this Republic (and therefore the world) as to-day, and then far more important in the future. Thus the time has by no means yet come for a thorough measurement of him. Nevertheless, we who live in his era&#8212;who have seen him, and heard him, face to face, and are in the midst of, or just parting from, the strong and strange events which he and we have had to do with, can in some respects bear valuable, perhaps indispensable testimony concerning him.</p>
        <p>I should first like to give a very fair and characteristic likeness of Lincoln, as I saw him and watch'd him one afternoon in Washington, for nearly half an hour, not long before his death. It was as he stood on the balcony of the National Hotel, Pennsylvania Avenue, making a short speech to the crowd in front, on the occasion either of a set of new colors presented to a famous Illinois regiment, or of the daring capture, by the Western men, of some flags from "the enemy," (which latter phrase, by the by, was not used by him at all in his remarks.) How the picture happen'd to be made I do not know, but I bought it a few days afterward in Washington, and it was endors'd by every one to whom I show'd it. Though hundreds of portraits have been made, by painters and photographers (many to pass on, by copies, to future times,) I have never seen one yet that in my opinion deserv'd to be called a perfectly <hi rend="italic">good likeness;</hi> nor to I believe there is really such a one in existence. May I not say too, that, as there is no entirely competent and emblematic likeness of Abraham Lincoln in picture or stature, there is not&#8212;perhaps cannot be&#8212;any fully appropriate literary statement or summing-up of him, yet in existence<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">.</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a218">?<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a218">&#711;</metamark></add></subst></p>
        <p>The best way to estimate the value of Lincoln is the think what the condition of America would be to-day, if he had never lived&#8212;never been President. His nomination and first election were mainly accidents, experiments. Severely view'd, one cannot think very much of American Political Parties, from the beginning, after <add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a219">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a219">t<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a219">/</metamark></add>he Revolutionary War, down to the present time. Doubtless, while they have had their uses&#8212;have been and are "the grass on which the cow feeds"&#8212;and indispensable economi<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">c</del><add seq="2" place="left">e</add></subst>s of growth&#8212;it is undeniable that under flippant names they have merely identified temporary passions, or freaks, or sometimes prejudice, ignorance, or hatred. The only thing like a great and worthy idea vitalizing a party, and making it heroic, was the enthusiasm in '64 for re-electing Abraham Lincoln, and

     the reason behind that enthusiasm.</p>
        <note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="left">George</note>
        <p>How does this man compare with the acknowledg'd "Father of his country"? Washington was model's on the best Saxon and Franklin of the age of the Stuarts (rooted in the Elizabethan period)&#8212;was essentially a noble Englishman, and just the kind needed for the occasions and the times of 1776&#8211;'83. Lincoln, underneath his practicality, was far less European, was quite thoroughly Western, original, essentially non-conventional, and had a certain sort of out-door or prairie stamp. One of the best of the late commentators on Shakspere (Professor Dowden<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a220">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a220">/</metamark></add></subst> makes the height and aggregate of his quality as a poet to be, that he thoroughly blended the ideal with the practical or realistic. If this be so, I should say that what Shakspere did in poetic expression, Abraham Lincoln essentially did in his personal and official life. I should say the invisible foundations and vertebra of his character, more than any man's in history, were mystical, abstract, moral and spiritual&#8212;while upon all of them was built, and out of all of them radiated, under the control of the average of circumstances, what the vulgar call <hi rend="italic">horse-sense</hi>, and a life often bent by temporary but most urgent materialistic and political reasons.</p>
        <p>He seems to have been a man of indomitable firmness (even obstinacy) on rare occasions, involving great points; but he was generally very easy, flexible, tolerant, almost slouchy, respecting minor matters. I note that even those reports and anecdotes intended to level him down, all leave the tinge of a favorable impression of him. As to his religious nature, it seems to me to have certainly been of the amplest, deepest-rooted, loftiest kind.</p>

        <p>But I do not care to dwell on the features presented so many times, and that will readily occur to every one in recalling Abraham Lincoln and his era.

I have moe than once fancied to myself the time when the present century has closed<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a222">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a222">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a222">/</metamark></add> and a new one open'd, and the men and deeds of that contest have become somewhat vague and mythical&#8212;fancied perhaps in some great Western city, or group collected together, or public festival, where the days of old, of 1863 and '4 and '5 or discuss'd&#8212;some ancient soldier sitting in the background as the talk goes on, and betraying himself by his emotion and moist eyes&#8212;like the journeying Ithacan at the banquet of King Alcino&#252;s, when the bard sings the contending warriors<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d057">,</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d057">d</metamark></add> and their battles on the plains of Troy:
        <l>"So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes,</l>
        <l>Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs."</l></p>
        <p>I have fancied, I say, some such venerable relic of this time of ours, preserv'd to the next or still the next generation of America. I have fancied on such occasion, the young men gathering around; the awe, the eager questions<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">.</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a223">:<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a223">/</metamark></add></subst> "What! have you seen Abraham Lincoln&#8212;and heard him speak&#8212;and touch'd his hand? Have you, with your own eyes, look'd on Grant, and Lee and Sherman?"</p>
        <p>Dear to Democracy, to the very last! And among the paradoxes generated by America<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a224">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="left" xml:id="a224">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a224">/</metamark></add> not the least curious<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d058">,</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d058">d</metamark></add> was that spectacle of all the kings and queens and emperors of the earth, many from remote distances, sending tributes of condolence and sorrow in memory of one rais'd through the commonest average of life&#8212;a rail-splitter and flat-boatman!</p>
