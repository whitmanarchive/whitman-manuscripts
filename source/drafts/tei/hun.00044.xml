     <p>This is a late-stage draft (with printer's instructions) of the essay "Father Taylor (and Oratory)," which first appeared in <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi> in February 1887. The piece would later be reprinted in <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi>. Edward Thompson Taylor was a Boston Methodist minister known for his powerful sermons, serving as the inspiration for Melville's "Father Mapple" in <hi rend="italic">Moby Dick</hi>. Whitman went to hear Taylor speak on several occasions during his stay in Boston in 1860.</p>
