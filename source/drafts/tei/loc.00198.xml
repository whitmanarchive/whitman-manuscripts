     <l>Right from the scented soil's May-utterance here,</l>
     <l>(Smelling of countless blessings, prayers, and old-time thanks),</l>

On such minor and personal incidents (so to call them), often depend the great growths and turns of civilization. This moment of a woman and a queen surely swung the grandest oscillation of modern history's pendulum.
