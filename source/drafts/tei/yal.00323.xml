He was a tho-rough-going anti-slavery believer, speaker and writer, (doctrinaire,) and though I took a fancy to him from the first, I remember I fear<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a003"><metamark function="emphasize" target="#a003">\</metamark>'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a003">/</metamark></add></subst>d his ardent abolitionism&#8212;was afraid it would pro-baly keep us apart. (I was a decided and out-spoken anti-slavery believer myself, then aud always; but shy'd from the extremists, the red-hot fellows of those times.) <del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d003">H.</del><add hand="#h02" place="left"><metamark function="delete" target="#d003">d</metamark></add> O'C. was then correcting the proofs of <hi rend="italic">Harrington</hi>, an eloquent and fiery novel he had written, and what was <subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">written</del><add seq="2" place="left" rend="marked">printed just</add></subst> before the commencement of the Secession War.

He had one child left, a fine bright little daughter, and a great comfort to her parents. (Dear Jeannie! She grew up a most accomplished and superior young woman&#8212;declined in health, and died about 1881.)</p>

He always applauded the masters, whence and whoever. I remember his special defences of Byron, Burns, Poe, Rabelais, Victor Hugo, George Sand, and others.
