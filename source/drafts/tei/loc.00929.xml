                <p>Our army is rapidly accumulating its traditions, its grand remembrances, around
                    which the regiments or larger aggregates, can rally. The regiment above named
                    must not be left in its honorable misfortune, (it was lately cut off &#38;
                    captured, nearly entire, west of Petersburgh, while bravely fighting) without
                    some memento at our hands. It will show to the myriads at home who know of
                    nothing but peaceful scenes, somewhat of the life <del rend="overstrike">their
                        brethren</del> our war-worn soldiers really undergo. Moreover the record
                    &#38; prestige of this regiment, <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion"
                        >&#38; of many others,</add> will be hints of that invicible Union army,
                    full of coolness &#38; pride ,&#38; hardened as fine steel, which we are
                    forming or rather have formed.</p>

                    career as soldiers has been too marked a one, &#38; must be run over from
                    the beginning.</p>
