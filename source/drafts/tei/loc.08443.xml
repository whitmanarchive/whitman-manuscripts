Abraham Lincoln, familiar, our own, an Illinoisan, modern, yet tallying ancient Moses, Joshua, Ulysses, or later Cromwell&#8212;and grander in some respects than any of them; Abraham Lincoln, that makes the like of Homer, Plutarch, Shakespere <add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a002">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a002">eligible</add> our day or any day. My subject this evening for 40 or 50 minutes' talk is the death of this man, and how that death will really filter into America. I am not going to tell you any thing new; and it is doubtless nearly altogether because I <add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a003">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a003">ardently</add> wish to commemorate the hour and martyrdom and name I am here. Oft as the <add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a004">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a004">rolling</add> years bring back this hour, let it again, however briefly, be dwelt upon. For my own part I hope and intend till my own dying day, whenever the 14th or 15th of April comes, to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic reminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence. It belongs to These States in their entirety&#8212;not the North only, but the South&#8212;perhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South of all; for there really this man's birth-stock; there and thence his antecedent stamp. Why should I not say that thence his manliest traits, his universality, his canny, easy <add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a005">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a005">ways and</add> words upon the surface&#8212;his inflexible determination at heart? Have you ever realized it, my friends, that Lincoln, though grafted on the West, is essentially in personnel and character a Southern contribution?<add place="inline" hand="#h02">"</add>
