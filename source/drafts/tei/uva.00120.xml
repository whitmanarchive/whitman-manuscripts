                all Whitman's writings are, a powerful sense of physical perfection, size, health, strength &#38; beauty, with great amativeness,adhesiveness, a wonderfully buoyant joyousness of spirit, and 
                immortality, not as an intellection, but as a pervading instinct.  With these comes forward far more prominently in "Two Rivulets," than in the
