     <p>This manuscript contains titles for a contemplated cluster of poems, "Annex at 69" and "Fancies at Navesink &#38; other pieces 1883 to 88." The poem sequence "Fancies at Navesink" first appeared in the August 1885 issue of <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century</hi>. The eight poems from this sequence were then reprinted in a section of <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi> entitled "Sands at Seventy" in 1888, which then became an annex to <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> that same year. The poems reappeared under the heading "Fancies at Navesink," although still part of "Sands at Seventy," in 1891. The manuscript was matted, along with a Frederick Gutekunst photograph of Whitman. Because of the matting, the verso of the manuscript is not accessible.</p>
