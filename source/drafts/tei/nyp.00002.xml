      <p>A nearly complete draft of an essay Whitman wrote for the English Edition of <hi rend="italic">Specimen Days</hi>. This essay first appeared in 1887 as "Additional Note. Written 1887 for the English Edition." Whitman slightly revised the title, changing it to "Additional Note, 1887, to English Edition 'Specimen Days,'" before including it in <hi rend="italic">Complete Prose Works</hi> (1892).</p>

   <p>As I write these lines I still continue living in Camden, New Jersey, America. Coming this way from Washington City, on my road to the sea&#11840;shore (and a temporary rest, as I supposed), in the early summer of 1873, I broke down disabled, <del rend="overstrike">here</del>and have <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">remained</del><add seq="2" place="above">dwelt</add></subst> here, <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">for</del><add seq="2" place="above">as</add></subst> my central residence, all the time since&#8212;almost 14 years. In the preceding pages I have described how, during those years, I partially recuperated (in 1876) from my worst paralysis, by going down to Timber Creek, <del rend="overstike">and</del>living close to Nature, and domiciling with my dear friends George and Susan Stafford. From 1877 <del rend="overstrike">to</del>or '8 to '83 or '4 I was well enough to travel around considerably&#8212;journey'd westward to Kansas,<add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a01">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a01">leisurely exploring The Prairies,</add> and on to Denver and the Rocky Mountains; another time north to Canada, where I spent most of the summer with my friend Dr Backe, and jaunted along the great lakes, and the St Laurence and Saquenay rivers; another time to Boston, to properly print the final edition of my poems, (I was there over two months, and had "a good time".) I have so brought out the completed "Leaves of Grass" during this period; also "Specimen Days," of which the foregoing is a transcript; collected and re&#8212;edited the "Democratic Vistas" cluster (see companion volume to the present_&#8212;commemorated Abraham Lincoln's death on the<add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a02">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a02">successive</add> anniversaries of its occurrence by delivering my lecture on it ten or twelve times; and "put in," through many a monthe and season the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives.</p>

   <p>Thus the last 14 years have passes. At present (end&#11840;day of March, 1887&#8212;I am nigh entering my 69th<!-- way to make this superscript?--> year) I find myself continuing on here, quite dilapidated and even wreck'd bodily, from the paralysis, <!-- etc code? -->&#8212;but in <hi rend="underline">good heart</hi> (to use a Long&#11840;Island country phrase) and with about the same mentality as ever. The worst of it is, I have been growing feebler quite rapidly for a year, and now can't walk around&#8212;hardly from one room to the next. I <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">have</del><add seq="2" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a03">&#8248;</metamark></add><add seq="3" place="above" xml:id="a03">am forced</add></subst> to stay in&#11840;doors and in my big chair nearly all the time. We have had a sharp dreary winter too, and it has pinched me. I am along most of the time; every week, indeed almost every day, write some&#8212;reminiscences, essays, sketches, for the magazines; and read, or rather I <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">may</del><add seq="2" place="above">should</add></subst> say dawdle over books and papers a good deal&#8212;spend half the day at that.</p>
   <p>Nor can I finish this note without putting on record&#8212;wafting over sea from hence&#8212;my deepest thanks to certain friends and helpers (I would specify them all and each by name, but imperative reasons, outside of my own wishes, forbid<add seq="1" place="right"><metamark function="add" target="#a04">&#8248;</metamark></add><add seq="2" place="below" xml:id="a04">even in the abstract</add>) in the British Islands, as well as in America. Dear is such flattering ??? always no doubt to the soul! Nigher still, if possible, I myself have been, and am to&#11840;day, indeb<del rend="overstrike">te</del>ted to such <del rend="overstrike">helf</del>help, for my very sustenance, clothing, shelter, and continuity. And I would not go to the grave without briefly but plainly, as I here do, acknowledging&#8212;may I not say even glorying in it?</p>
   <p>Finally, dear reader, to end all gossip and egotism, let me give you one of my cherish'd thoughts for a parting word. I wrote and published it ???? of</p>
