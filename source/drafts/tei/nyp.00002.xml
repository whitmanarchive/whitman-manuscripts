   <p>As I write these lines I still continue living in Camden, New Jersey, America. Coming this way from Washington City, on my road to the sea&#11840;shore (and a temporary rest, as I supposed), in the early summer of 1873, I broke down disabled, <del rend="overstrike">here</del>and have <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">remained</del><add seq="2" place="above">dwelt</add></subst> here, <subst><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">for</del><add seq="2" place="above">as</add></subst> my central residence, all the time since&#8212;almost 14 years. In the preceding pages I have described how, during those years, I partially recuperated (in 1876) from my worst paralysis, by going down to Timber Creek, <del rend="overstike">and</del>living close to Nature, and domiciling with my dear friends George and Susan Stafford.

I have so brought out the completed "Leaves of Grass" during this period; also "Specimen Days," of which the foregoing is a transcript; collected and re&#8212;edited the "Democratic Vistas" cluster (see companion volume to the present_&#8212;commemorated Abraham Lincoln's death on the<add place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a02">&#8248;</metamark></add><add place="above" xml:id="a02">successive</add> anniversaries of its occurrence by delivering my lecture on it ten or twelve times; and "put in," through many a monthe and season the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives.</p>
