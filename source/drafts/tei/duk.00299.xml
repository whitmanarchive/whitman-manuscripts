            <note type="project" target="dat1">Whitman probably drafted this manuscript in the mid-1850s. It may describe what eventually became section 9 of the poem titled "I Sing the Body Electric." Although a version of that poem, titled "Leaves of Grass," appeared in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, that section was first added to the poem in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>. Edward Grier speculates that the pink paper used for this manuscript may have been a wrapper from the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, which if true would date this manuscript to 1855.</note>
