            <note type="project" target="#dat1">These notes include early drafts of lines and topics used in a notebook poem unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "<ref target="yal.00081.html">Pictures</ref>," which was probably written in the mid- to late 1850s. The first several lines of the notebook draft were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. "My Picture-Gallery" was later published in the 1881 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster. Harold Aspiz argues that the "death song" proposed in the last line of this manuscript became the poem "So Long!," first added to <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> in 1860 (<hi rend="italic">So Long! Walt Whitman's Poetry of Death</hi> [Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 2004], 152). The manuscript is written on the blank side of an 1850s tax form from the City of Williamsburgh, which is probably why Edward Grier dates it to between 1857 and 1860 (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 4:1366). Scholars, following Fredson Bowers, have generally assumed that Whitman used the Williamsburgh tax forms from 1857 to 1860, while he was working at the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</hi>. The city of Williamsburgh was incorporated with Brooklyn effective January 1855, so the forms would have been obsolete after that date (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass</hi> [1860] [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955], xli–xliii). Most of the manuscripts Whitman wrote on the tax forms can be dated to the late 1850s. Bowers also notes, however, that Whitman may have used the forms over a considerable span of time, and that "it is not impossible that Whitman had picked up these tax forms for scrap paper at Rome Brothers at some unknown date in 1854 or early 1855, or later" (xliii). At least two of the tax forms Whitman used were dated 1854 (see, for instance, "<ref target="loc.05354.html">Vast national tracts</ref>"), but as Grier points out, this may not correspond to the date of Whitman's writing (5:1946). Whitman may have found a stack of obsolete Williamsburgh forms in 1857 that included discarded draft forms dated earlier. The manuscript is thus difficult to date conclusively, but the relationship to "Pictures" would suggest it was likely written in the mid-1850s.</note>
