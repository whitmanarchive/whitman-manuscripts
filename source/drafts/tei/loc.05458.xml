                <note type="project"><p>This manuscript is a draft of the prose section "Health, Old
                        Style," which was published in Whitman's book <hi rend="italic">Good-Bye My
                            Fancy</hi>, 2nd Annex to <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>
                        (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1891). This manuscript page consists of a pasted
                        on manuscript in Whitman's hand, prose notes in Whitman's hand, including
                        both printing instructions and notes that would later contribute to a
                        headnote that accompanied a poem entitled "Health," that was also printed in
                        the "Health, Old Style," section of Whitman's <hi rend="italic">Good-Bye My
                            Fancy</hi>, 2nd Annex to <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>
                        (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1891).</p>
                    
                    <p>This manuscript includes a clipping of the poem "Health," written by "George
                        Davies (G. D.) Harley," which spans two pages. This poem was first published
                        in the June 1797 issue of the <hi rend="italic">The Monthly Mirror</hi>, a
                        London magazine. It was reprinted in Harley's book <hi rend="italic">Ballad
                            Stories, Sonnets, &#38;c.</hi> (Bath, Printed by R. Cruttwell),
                        I:35&#8211;36. The copy Whitman pasted into a scrapbook, according to his notes, then
                        clipped and pasted onto this manuscript may be taken from <hi
                            rend="italic">The American Poetical Miscellany</hi> (Vol. 1, 1809) based
                        on the wording of the line "Yet bids the biting blast more fiercely blow"
                        (191). The wording of this line of the poem does not match that found in either 
                        <hi rend="italic">The Monthly Mirror</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ballad
                            Stories, Sonnets, &#38;c.</hi>, but it does match that in the <hi
                                rend="italic">The American Poetical Miscellany</hi>.
                        <!--https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_American_Poetical_Miscellany_The_Ame/oq08zv9H7JsC?hl=en&gbpv=0-->
                        Whitman has not pasted the entire printed poem on the manuscript. He writes the last two stanzas
                        in black ink on a blank section of the scrapbook page that he pasted onto the manuscript.

                    <p>The "Perfect Health" manuscript, that has been pasted onto this manuscript draft of the "Health, Old Style," 
                        section of <hi rend="italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</hi>, is written on what is almost
                        certainly a blue Williamsburgh tax form. This manuscript may be related to
                        Whitman's prose notes, also on Blue Williamsburgh tax forms, that are now
                        part of what is known as the "Physique" Notebook or the Notebook on "Physique,"
                        which is now part of The Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of the Papers of
                        Walt Whitman, 1842&#8211;1937, Library of Congress, Washington,
                        D.C. Whitman likely wrote "Perfect Health," in 1857 or 1858 since the manuscript
                        includes numerous words and phrases that appear in the "Conclusion" section of the
                        final installment of Whitman's newspaper series, "Manly Health and Training,"
                        which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">New York Atlas</hi> on December 26, 1858.
                        Whitman seemingly preserved this page and the other materials in the Physique Notebook
                        for more than thirty years before revising the material that appears in "Perfect Health" (and by 
                        extension that appeared in "Manly Health") to more fully describe his physical health
                        and its decline during his final years.
