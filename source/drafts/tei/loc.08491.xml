   <p>y Morning, June 11&#8212;<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">On a sand</del><gap reason="cut away" extent="one word"/><del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">the St. Clair flats, where we had been stuck for a couple of hours.</del>We pass<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">e</del>d down Lake Huron <choice><orig>yester-<lb/> day</orig><reg>yesterday</reg></choice> and last night, and between 4 and 5 o'clock this morning we ran on the "flats," and have been mainly trying, with the aid of a steam <gap reason="cut away" extent="one word"/> and a <choice><orig>lum-<lb/> bering</orig><reg>lumbering</reg></choice> lighter, to get cl<gap reason="cut away" extent="three letters"></gap> again. The day is beautiful and th<gap reason="cut away" extent="four letters"/>er clear and calm. Night before last we stop<del rend="overstrike">ped</del> at Mackinaw, (the island and town,) and I went up on the old fort, one of the <choice><orig>old-<lb/> est</orig><reg>oldest</reg></choice> stations in the Northwest. We expect to get to Buffalo by to-morrow. The tug has fasten<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">ed</del> lines to us, but some have been snap<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">ped</del> and the others have no effect. We seem to be firmly <choice><orig>imbed-<lb/> ded</orig><reg>imbedded</reg></choice> in the sand. (With the exception of a larger boat and better <choice><orig>accommoda-<lb/> tions</orig><reg>accommodations</reg></choice>, it amounts to about the same thing as a becalmment I underwent on the Mountauk voyage, East Long Island, last summer.)  Later.&#8212;We are off again&#8212;expect to reach Detroit before dinner.</p>
   <p>We did not stop at Detroit. We are now on Lake Erie, jogging along at a good round pace. A couple of hours since we were on the river above.  <choice><orig>De-<lb/> troit</orig><reg>Detroit</reg></choice> seem<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">e</del>d to me a pretty place and thrifty. I especially liked the looks of the Canadian shore opposite and of the little village of Windsor, and, indeed, all along the banks of the river. From the shrubbery and the neat appearance of some of the cottages, I think it must have been settled by the French. While I now write we can see a little distance ahead the scene of the battle between Perry's fleet and the British during the last war with England. The lake looks to me like a fine sheet of water. We are having a beautiful day.</p>
   <p>June 12.&#8212;We stop<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">ped</del> last evening at Cleveland, and though it was dark, I took the opportunity of rambling about the place; went up in the heart of the city and back to what appear<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">ed</del> to be the courthouse. The streets are <choice><orig>unusu-<lb/> ally</orig><reg>unusually</reg></choice> wide, and the buildings appear to be substantial and comfortable. We went down through Main street and found, some distance along, several squares of ground very prettily planted with trees and looking attractive enough. Return<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h03">e</del>d to the boat by way of the lighthouse on the hill.</p>
