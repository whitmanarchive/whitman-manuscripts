      <p>Signed draft of "The Dead Tenor," approximately 14 lines, written on several scraps pasted together. A newspaper clipping with the death notice of Pasquale Brignoli is pasted in the bottom lefthand corner. The poem was first published on 8 November 1884 in the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> and reprinted in the "Sands at Seventy" annex of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> (1891–92). Whitman was inspired to write the poem by the death of Pasquale (or Pasqualino) Brignoli (1824–1884), a tenor who made his New York debut in 1854 and remained a popular favorite for twenty years. According to Horace Traubel, Whitman appears to have known Brignoli. On the verso can be found various writings, including an earlier draft of The Dead Tenor, part of a letter to Whitman from Charles F. Blanch, and an unidentified prose jotting by Whitman.</p>
