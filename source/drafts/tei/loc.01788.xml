                Interview between Mr. Ashton &#38; Mr. Harlan, took place, <del rend="overstrike">Aug</del> July 1st, 1865, at the Room of the Secretary of the Interior, in the Patent Office.  <del rend="overstrike">
                Mr. As</del>  Mr. Ashton drove down there, from the Attorney General's, <del rend="overstrike"><add place="supralinear" rend="unmarked">in</add></del> about 10 oclock a. m. &#38; remained <del 
                    rend="overstrike">till</del> over an hour.  The interview <del rend="overstrike">was an</del> consisted of a most animated conversation.  Judge W. J. Otto was present, but took little or no part in the
                discussion.  The Assistant Attorney General asked why W. W. was dismissed; asked if he had been found inattentive to his duties,<!-- [TJ] Is "duties" written over "dues"? --> or incompetent for them.  Mr. Harlan said, No, <del rend="overstrike">as
                </del> there was no complaint on those points.  As far as he
                <subst>
                    <del rend="overstrike" seq="1">knew,</del>
                    <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion" seq="2">heard</add>
                </subst>
                <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion">or knew,</add> W. was a both <add place="supralinear" rend="unmarked">a</add> competent &#38; faithful clerk.  Mr. Ashton then
                <subst>
                    <del rend="overstrike" seq="1">asked</del>
                    <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion" seq="2">said, Then</add>
                </subst>
                What is the reason?  The Secretary said, <del rend="overstrike">it i</del> W. was the author of Leaves of Grass.  Ashton, said, Well, is that the reason?  The Secretary said, Yes.  He then went into a sort of
                narrative to the following purport.  He was examining <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">round</unclear> the building, after after office hours, &#38; either

            in or on a desk, he saw the Book.  He took it up, &#38; found it so odd, that he <del rend="overstrike">took</del> carried it to his room &#38; examined it.  He found certain passages marked; and there were
                marks
                <subst>
                    <del rend="overstrike" seq="1"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">erased</unclear></del>

                </subst>
                &#38; upon passages all through the book.  He found <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">ind</unclear></del> in the book <del rend="overstrike">such</del> in <del 
                    rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">suc</unclear></del> some of these marked passages, <del rend="overstrike">such lines &#38; opinion</del> matter so outrageous that he 
                had determined to discharge the author, &#38;c. &#38;c. &#38;c.                  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr. Ashton then went into a statement of the theory of the book&#8212;that a construction of that kind put upon the passages was not consistent
                either with the intention of W. W. <del rend="overstrike">the au</del> or the rest of the drift of the book&#8212;That he knew what the <del rend="overstrike">author</del> spirit &#38; intention of the
                author, &#38; <del rend="overstrike">that</del> they were noble, whatever merit, <del rend="overstrike">there</del> or deficiency of merit, there might be in the book.  Mr. Harlan said: Well, he couldn't help 
                that.  He thought the author <del rend="overstrike">would have a bad effect was an unprof</del> was wrong, was a free lover, deserved punishment, &#38;c.

                The Assistant Attorney General said; <del rend="overstrike">Now I know</del> Mr. Harlan, I know something of W. W's life, &#38; if you will listen to me I will tell you what it has been.  He then described
                Ws life throughout, as manly, pure, &#38; patriotic.  Since the commencement of the war he had devoted himself to the care of the wounded &#38; sick of our armies; had been

                leisure hours in the service of the maimed &#38; sick, in camps &#38; hospitals around Washington, &#38; was now continuing quietly &#38; faithfully at that work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr. Harlan said <del rend="overstrike">,</del> after this; You have changed my opinion of his personal character, but I shall adhere to my decision dismissing him.

            <p>
                On the Assistant Attorney General <del rend="overstrike">press</del> commencing some remarks <del rend="overstrike">toward a to controvert</del> involving a change of that decision, Mr. Harlan said, "It's
                no use, Mr. Ashton.&#8212;I will not have the author of that book in this Department&#8212;No, if the President of the United States should order his reinstatement, I would resign sooner than I would put him
                back."
            </p>
            <p>
                He then went into a long &#38; angry abuse of the book, <del rend="overstrike">its</del> its offensive passages, &#38; of<!-- [TJ] Is "of" a del or a blotch? --> W. W. to which the Assistant Attorney General made no reply, but bowed &#38; took
                his leave.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is perhaps a main part <del rend="overstrike"><add place="supralinear" rend="unmarked"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">go</unclear></add></del> of this transaction, and the getting of a
