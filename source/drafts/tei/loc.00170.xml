            <note type="project" target="dat1">A note written at the top of this manuscript (possibly by Richard Maurice Bucke) declares that it was from before the Civil War. This is consistent with the fact that it is written on the reverse of a City of Williamsburgh tax form. Scholars, following Fredson Bowers, have generally assumed that Whitman used the Williamsburgh tax forms from 1857 to 1860, while he was working at the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</hi>. The city of Williamsburgh was incorporated with Brooklyn effective January 1855, so the forms would have been obsolete after that date (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass [1860]</hi> [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955], xliâ€“xliii). Bowers also notes, however, that "it is not impossible that Whitman had picked up these tax forms for scrap paper at Rome Brothers at some unknown date in 1854 or early 1855, or later" (xliii). This possibility would seem to be supported by the fact that some of the tax forms Whitman used are dated as early as 1854 (see "<ref target="loc.05354.html">Vast national tracts</ref>"), and some of the manuscript material written on them would seem to date earlier than 1857 (see "<ref target="loc.05180.html">The idea of reconciliation</ref>"). This manuscript was therefore probably written between 1854 and 1860.</note>
