        <p>The second paragraph of this manuscript includes <ref target="#q01" xml:id="r01" type="text">phrases and ideas</ref> similar to the following lines from the poem "Poem of Perfect Miracles," later titled "Miracles": "To me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle, / Every inch of space is a miracle, / Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same" (1856, p. 280).</p>

            <p>The second paragraph of this manuscript bears some resemblance to the last two lines of a notebook poem unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "<ref target="yal.00081.html">Pictures</ref>": " And every hour of the day and night has given deposited with me copious pictures, / And every rod of land or sea affords me, as long as I live, inimitable
                pictures." The first several lines of the notebook draft were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. The poem was later published in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster (1881, p. 310).</p>

            <p>It is possible that this manuscript relates to the following line in the preface to the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>: "These understand the law of perfection in masses and floods . . . that its finish is to each for itself and onward from itself . . . that it is profuse and impartial . . . that there is not a minute of the light or dark nor an acre of the earth or sea without itâ€”nor any direction of the sky nor any trade or employment nor any turn of events" (1855, p. vi).</p>
        </work>
        <work ref="xxx.00119" cert="low">
            <p>It is also possible this manuscript relates to the following line in the poem eventually titled "A Song for Occupations": "The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees . . . . and the wonders that fill
                each minute of time forever and each acre of surface and space forever," (1855, p. 59).</p>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Based on the handwriting, Edward Grier dates this manuscript to the 1850s (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:203). The second paragraph of the manuscript includes phrases and ideas similar to lines from the poem "Miracles," which was first published as "Poem of Perfect Miracles" in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The second paragraph also bears some resemblance to the last two lines of a notebook poem unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "<ref target="yal.00081.html">Pictures</ref>," as well as to lines in the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The manuscript has been mounted, so an image of the reverse is unavailable.</note>
