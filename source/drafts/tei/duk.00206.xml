        <note type="project">In the Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, this manuscript is bound with a photograph of Walter Whitman, Sr. Based on available information, however, it is not clear whether Whitman or a collector bound the items together.</note>
        <note type="project" target="#leaf001v">Images of the three versos are currently available.</note>
        <note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman's date at the top of the page suggests this manuscript was likely composed on November 23, 1862. Whitman resided at Portland Avenue from May 1859 until he left New York for Virginia in search of his brother George, who had been wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, in December 1862.  The note on the verso of the second leaf, "Vedder at Brother Jonathan," may refer to the painter Elihu Vedder. Whitman could have met Vedder at Pfaff's beer cellar when Vedder returned to New York after studying in France and traveling in Italy.</note>
