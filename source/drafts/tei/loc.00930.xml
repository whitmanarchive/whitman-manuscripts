            <p>We print in another column a communication on the exchange of prisoners of war, which
                has been sent us by Walt Whitman, who, we understand, is a steadfast member of a
                republican family, &#38; therefore not likely to find fault with the
                administration without grounds. Our government seems to be desirous of building
                itself a name for bad faith toward its captured soldiers, that will be a stain on it
                forever &#38; in both immediate &#38; prospective results will certainly lose
                it more than it will gain.</p>

            <p>It is now well known by all in the inside circles that the stick about exchanging the
                blacks is only a pretense for popular effect, &#38; that the <subst>
                    <del rend="overstrike" seq="1">course</del>
                    <add place="supralinear" rend="unmarked" seq="2">policy</add>
                </subst> of the War Department is to let the Union prisoners south die off while we
                return the captured southerners.</p>

            <p>Mr Whitman we think utters the general opinion of all the candid men of his
                own &#38; every party in the land, in saying in plain terms that the wholesale
                deaths of our sons &#38; brethren in southern stockades the past year rest on no
                other than the heads of <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion">members
                of</add> our own government.</p>
