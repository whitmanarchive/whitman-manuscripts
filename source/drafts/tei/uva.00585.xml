         <p>This manuscript includes lines that also appear in a longer manuscript notebook draft of a poem unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "Pictures." The first several lines of the notebook, which include versions of the last two lines of this manuscript, were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. The poem was later published in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster (1881, p. 310).</p>

            <note type="project" target="#dat1">The last two lines of this manuscript were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. The poem was later published in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster (1881, p. 310). The lines also appeared in an earlier and longer manuscript poem titled "<ref target="yal.00081.html">Pictures</ref>." Richard Maurice Bucke dates these manuscript lines to around 1880, just before "My Picture-Gallery" was published. But Whitman's early style of inscription in this draft, along with the line "It is round—it has room for America, north and south," and his use of his own name in the deleted first line, all suggest that Whitman may have inscribed this draft around the same time that he was working on the 1856 "Poem of Salutations" (eventually "Salut au Monde!"). This draft also suggests that at one point he may have considered linking what would become "Poem of Salutations" and the formally and thematically similar "Pictures" more directly. Faintly visible at the bottom of the manuscript is the phrase "inland and seaboard," which appeared in the poem first published in 1860 as number 24 of the "Calamus" cluster and eventually titled "I Hear It was Charged against Me." In a transcription of this manuscript that appears in <hi rend="italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman: Leaves of Grass</hi>, Vol. 3 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), the final line reads: "It is round&#8212;Behold! it has room for America, north and south, seaboard and inland, persons . . . " (268).</note>
