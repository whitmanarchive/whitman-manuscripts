                 To day is Walt Whitman's 65th birth-day, as he was born at Huntington, Long Island, May 31, 1819.  He grew up in Brooklyn and New York
                 cities, and by the sea&#8209;shore, received merely a <add place="supralinear" rend="insertion">child's</add> common school education,
                and worked in a printing&#8209;office as boy and young man.  He commenced his famous "Leaves of Grass", in 1855 and thenceforward adding
                new instalments every few years, completed it in 1882.  He engaged in the Secession War as a volunteer nurse of the army wounded,      
                working
                <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">pe</unclear></del> practically and ardently, (but "on his own
                hook") on the battle fields and in the hospitals for over three years.  It was

                derived the paralysis that now and since afflicts him.

            <p>&#182;Besides the poems of "Leaves of Grass," he has written and published a book of prose, "Specimen Days and Collect," whose nature
                and contents are indicated by the name.  A detailed biography of Whitman, and analysis of his poems, <del rend="overstrike">written
                </del> by Dr. Bucke, a Canadian, was issued simultaneously here and in England about a year ago.  At the end <add place="supralinear"
                    rend="insertion">of the volume,</add> Dr. B. collects a curious and ample budget of the diverse views and arguments, for and against
                Whitman, covering twenty five years, from all parts of the world.

            <p>&#182;The poet now lives in a little old house he has lately bought near the Delaware river, in Camden.  Though crippled permanently

                loves the open air and the sights of active life, and manages to get out in them almost every day.  He sells his books himself ("to keep
                a certain animal from the door," as he expresses it,) sending them by mail <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">
