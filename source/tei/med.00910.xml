                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances of its composition, but it is possible that it was written in the early 1850s as Whitman was preparing materials for the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The phrasing and imagery are reminiscent of a line in the first poem of that edition (eventually titled "Song of Myself"), suggesting that this manuscript was composed before or early in 1855.</note>
