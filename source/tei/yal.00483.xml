                    the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Lines from the manuscript appear in the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself."</note>

                        <p>Revised versions of these draft lines appear in the first poem in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, later titled "Song of Myself": "I resist anything better than my own diversity, / And breathe the air and leave plenty after me, / And am not stuck up, and am in my place. / The moth and the fisheggs are in their place, / The suns I see and the suns I cannot see are in their place, / The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place" (1855, p. 24).</p>

                        <p>There is a possibility that this manuscript relates to the following lines in the poem later titled "I Sing the Body Electric": "The male is perfect and that of the female is perfect" (1855, p. 77), "The female contains all qualities and tempers them . . . . she is in her place . . . .
                            she moves with perfect balance," (1855, p. 80) and "The male is not less the soul, nor more . . . . he too is in his place," (1855, p. 80).</p>
