            <note type="project" target="#dat1">This fragmentary manuscript was almost certainly written in 1855, probably around or just after the publication of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. It appears to be part of a draft of a review essay by Whitman titled "<ref target="../../criticism/reviews/lg1855/anc.00014.html">An English and an American Poet</ref>." Whitman published the essay anonymously in the <hi rend="italic">American Phrenological Journal</hi> in October 1855, and he also printed and included it with other reviews in some copies of the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. He printed the review yet again in a section of reviews called "Opinions. 1855–6" at the end of the 1856 edition.</note>

                  <p>This prose fragment appears to be part of a draft of the essay, written by Whitman, titled "An English and an American Poet." Whitman published the essay anonymously in the <hi rend="italic">American Phrenological Journal</hi> in October 1855, and he also printed and included it with other reviews in some copies of the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The fragments of text match the following lines: "It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connection with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female. Poetry, to Tennyson and his British and American eleves, is a gentleman of the first degree, boating, fishing, and shooting genteelly through nature, admiring the ladies, and talking to them in company with that elaborate half-choked deference that is to be made up by the terrible license of men among themselves. The spirit of the burnished society of upper-class England fills this writer and his effusions from top to toe. Like that, he does not ignore courage and the superior qualities of men, but all is to show forth through dandyfied forms."</p>
