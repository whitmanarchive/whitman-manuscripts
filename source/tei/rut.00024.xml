                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This prose note has no known connection to Whitman's published work. The material on the back of the leaf, which was included in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, suggests that the manuscript was likely written around 1855. The manuscript is held at Rutgers University Library along with several similar manuscripts that are numbered sequentially and probably date from around or before 1855: see "<ref target="rut.00010.html">American literature must become distinct</ref>," "<ref target="rut.00022.html">dithyrambic trochee</ref>," and "<ref target="rut.00023.html">The only way in which</ref>."</note>
