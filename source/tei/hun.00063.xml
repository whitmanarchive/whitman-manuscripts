    <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript was likely composed after January 5, 1863.  Whitman's date of "Jan. 63" at the top of the page likely refers both to his visit(s) with Union soldier T. H. B. Geiger and the composition of the manuscript. Geiger was wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, December 11&#8211;15, 1862. His arm was amputated on January 5, 1863 at Armory Square Hospital, and he remained hospitalized there after the amputation (see Walt Whitman, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi>, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 2:604n24).</note>
