                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Lines from this manuscript were used in the preface to the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The sentence that begins "The soul has that measureless pride..." also later became part of the poem "Song of Prudence." Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances of its composition, but it was probably written before or early in 1855.</note>
