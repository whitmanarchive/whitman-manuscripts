We affirm there can be unnumbered Supremes, and that one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another . . and that men can be good or grand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them" (1855, p. vii).</p></work>

The lines read: "Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme? / There can be any number of Supremes—one does not countervail another any more than one eye-sight countervails another, or one life countervails another. / All is eligible to all, / All is for individuals—all is for you, / No condition is prohibited, not God's or any, / If one is lost, you are inevitably lost" (1856, pp. 180–181).</p></work>
