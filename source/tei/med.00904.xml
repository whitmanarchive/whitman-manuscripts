        <work ref="xxx.00048" cert="low"><p>Language in this manuscript is similar to the following line from the first poem in the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, titled "Leaves of Grass," eventually titled "Song of Myself": "Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush;" (1855, p. 36).</p></work>
        <work ref="xxx.00259" cert="low"><p>Language in this manuscript is also similar to a line in a manuscript notebook with a draft poem unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "Pictures." The line in "Pictures" reads: "And there, rude graveâ€‘mounds in California&#8212;and there a path worn in the grass." The first several lines of "Pictures" (not including this line) were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. The poem was later published in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster (1881, p. 310).</p></work>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances of its composition. The phrase "path worn in the grass" appears in the 1855 poem eventually titled "Song of Myself." Language in the manuscript is also similar to language that appears in the poem "Poem of Joys" (1860), eventually titled "Song of Joys"; "A Farm Picture" (1867); and the manuscript poem "Pictures." Although Bucke has grouped the lines together in his transcription, there is also a possibility that they represent three separate manuscripts.</note>
