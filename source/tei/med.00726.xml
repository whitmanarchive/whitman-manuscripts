In the manuscript Whitman mentions the "superb wonder of a blade of grass," which is similar in topic to the following line: "I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars" (1855, p. 34).</p></work>

            <p>In the prose preface to the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, Whitman also writes that "every spear of grass and the frames and spirits of men and women and all that concerns them are unspeakably perfect miracles" (1855, p. viii).</p>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Because this manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances or date of its composition, but based on the content it seems likely that it was written between <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1855">1850 and 1855</date>, when Whitman was composing his first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The manuscript note about the "superb wonder of a blade of grass" may relate to similar statements in the prose preface and the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself." In <hi rend="italic">Notes and Fragments</hi>, Richard Maurice Bucke transcribes the manuscript with "<ref target="nyp.00112.html">Enter into the thoughts of</ref>" and describes it as "a very early note, the paper torn and almost falling to pieces."</note>
