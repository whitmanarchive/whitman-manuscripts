        <work ref="xxx.00048" cert="high"><p>This manuscript likely contributed to the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself." Whitman mentions the "superb wonder of a blade of grass" and uses the term "Koboo," which appeared in the poem in 1855 (p. 49). The idea of "[e]nter[ing] into the thoughts of the different theological faiths" (described in this manuscript) is possibly connected to the stanza of "Song of Myself" that begins "I do not despise you priests..." (1855, p. 48).</p></work>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript likely contributed to the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself." In it Whitman mentions the "superb wonder of a blade of grass" and uses the term "Koboo," which appeared in the poem in 1855.  Gary Schmidgall glosses the term "koboo" as referring to "a native of Sumatra," and Andrew Lawson has noted that Whitman apparently picked up the reference from a book by Walter M. Gibson, an American adventurer (<hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman, Selected Poems, 1855&#8211;1892</hi>, ed. Gary Schmidgall [New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1999], 488; <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman and the Class Struggle</hi> [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2006], 91).  The manuscript has not been found.  In <hi rend="italic">Notes and Fragments</hi>, Richard Maurice Bucke describes it as "a very early note, the paper torn and almost falling to pieces." The date of the manuscript is almost certainly before 1855.</note>
