<p>It is possible that <ref type="text" xml:id="r01" target="#q01 #q02">lines in this manuscript</ref> represent an early draft of lines from the poem that was eventually titled "Salut au Monde!," first published as "Poem of Salutation" in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. In the poem, Whitman writes "I see where druids walk'd the groves of Mona ... / I see Christ eating the bread of his last supper in the midst of youths and old persons," (1891, p. 115–116).</p>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">The notes written in ink on this manuscript probably relate to the poem that was eventually titled "Salut au Monde!," first published as "Poem of Salutation" in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The earlier lines written in pencil may relate to the sixth poem in the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, eventually titled "Faces." These connections suggest the manuscript was probably written in the early to mid-1850s. The manuscript is pasted down, so an image of the reverse is not currently available.</note>
