                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript appears to be a partial draft of a piece of fiction about a character named Ganguernet. The January 1844 issue of <hi rend="italic">The Knickerbocker</hi> magazine featured a story called "Ganguernet: Or, 'A Capital Joke,'" which was "Translated from the French by John Hunter." The story includes a scene with a nearly identical plot to the one described in this portion of Whitman's manuscript, although the wording is, for the most part, quite different. It is unclear whether Whitman was simply paraphrasing Hunter's translation, or whether both stories were derived separately from the same source text. On the back of the leaf is a draft of Whitman's early poem "The Play-Ground," which was published in the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</hi> on June 1, 1846. As the prose draft is crossed out and the poetry draft is not, it is likely that the poetry draft was written later. Thus, the date of composition for the prose manuscript is probably between 1844 and 1846.  The title "The Play-Ground" is written vertically along the left side of this leaf, presumably labeling the material on the reverse.</note>

            <p><gap reason="cut away" atLeast="1" unit="lines"/> far. Amongst this latter class, I shall merely recount one, which may give some idea of the
                extent to which Mr Ganguernet carried his passion for frolic, as well as the
                serious consequences sometimes attendant on these <choice><sic>passtimes</sic><corr>pastimes</corr></choice>.</p>
            
            <p>It is about three weeks since Mr Ernest de B..... invited several of his friends on
                a hunting party; Ganguernet was among the invited. Just as the guests arrived Ernest
                was sealing a letter which he had <del rend="overstrike"><unclear cert="medium"
                        reason="illegible" resp="#ktl">ju</unclear></del> been writing; he placed it
                in the chimney piece whilst he greeted his friends with a welcome.</p>
            
            <p>Ganguernet, with his usual curiosity took up the letter, and having looked at the
                direction&#8212;Ah, said he, you have been writing to your sister in law.</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Yes replied Ernest, in an indifferent tone; I have been giving her notice that
                she may expect us all <del rend="overstrike">to</del> at dinner this evening at
                seven oclock; As our party is rather large (fifteen, I believe) I thought it prudent
                to give her notice, lest <del rend="overstrike"><unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">by</unclear></del> taking her by <choice>
                    <orig>surprize</orig><reg>surprise</reg></choice>, we might run the risk of finding but a poor dinner.</p>
            
            <p>Ernest rang the bell, and gave the note to the servant with directions to take it to
                the chateau of his sister in law. No one however perceived that Ganguernet left the
                room at the same moment.</p>
            
            <p>In the course of half an hour all the party had started for the field, each choosing th<unclear reason="obscured" cert="high" resp="#ktl">eir</unclear> different
                directions. Ganguernet and another <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">young
