            <p>This manuscript may relate to the first poem in the <date when="1855">1855</date> edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, ultimately titled "Song of Myself." The idea of "[e]nter[ing] into the thoughts of the different theological faiths" described in this manuscript may connect to the stanza of the poem eventually titled "Song of Myself" that begins "My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths..." including in particular the line "Making a fetish of the first rock or stump . . . . powowing with sticks in the circle of obis" (1855, p. 48). Whitman also used the term "koboo" in the 1855 version of that poem: "Nor the numberless slaughtered and wrecked . . . . nor the brutish koboo, called the ordure of humanity" (1855, p. 49).</p>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript was likely written between <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1855">1850 and 1855</date>, when Whitman was preparing materials for the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The idea of "[e]nter[ing] into the thoughts of the different theological faiths" described in this manuscript probably connects to the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself." Whitman also used the term "koboo" in that poem. Gary Schmidgall glosses the term "koboo" as referring to "a native of Sumatra," and Andrew Lawson has noted that Whitman apparently picked up the reference from a book by Walter M. Gibson, an American adventurer (<hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman, Selected Poems, 1855–1892</hi>, ed. Gary Schmidgall [New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1999], 488; <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman and the Class Struggle</hi> [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2006], 91). The manuscript is pasted down, so an image of the reverse is not available.</note>
