         <p>The final line from this manuscript is similar to a line from the poem that would eventually be titled "I Sing the Body Electric": "Your mother . . . . is she living? . . . . Have you been much with her? and has she 
            been much with you?" (1855, p. 82). 
            
            The list of words in the manuscript also bears some resemblance to the following lines in the same poem: "Undulating into the willing and yielding day, / ... / This is the bath of birth . . . this is the merge of small and large and the outlet again" (1855, p. 79).</p>

         <p>The discussion of the speed of the stars in this manuscript bears some resemblance to the following lines in the poem ultimately titled "Song of Myself": "Speeding through space . . . . speeding through heaven and the stars, / Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty
            thousand miles, / Speeding with tailed meteors . . . . throwing fire-balls like the rest" (1855, pp. 37–38).</p>

            <note type="project" target="dat1">Whitman probably drafted this
               manuscript in the <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1855">early 1850s</date> as he was composing
               the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Language in the manuscript is similar to lines that appeared in the fifth poem in that edition, later titled "I Sing the Body Electric." For further discussion of the relationship between this manuscript and the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, see Kenneth M. Price, "The Lost Negress of 'Song of Myself' and the Jolly Young Wenches of Civil War Washington," in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass: The Sesquicentennial Essays</hi>, ed.
