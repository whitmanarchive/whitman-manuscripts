      <p>This manuscript includes prose notes that relate to what became section 2 of "I Sing the Body Electric," first published as the fifth poem in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. It appeared revised as "Poem of the Body" in the 1856 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, and in the 1867 edition it was given its final title and divided into nine sections. The manuscript notes describe firemen "returning slowly home" from a fire, anticipating the description in the following lines: "The march of firemen in their own costumes—the play of the masculine muscle through cleansetting trowsers and waistbands, / The slow return from the fire . . . . the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again—the listening on the alert" (1855, p. 78).</p>

      <p>Based on the language and connections to the material about Egypt on the verso and on the other manuscript scrap pasted to the same backing sheet, the first of these notes may relate to information Whitman used to write his article "One of the Lessons Bordering Broadway: The Egyptian Museum," published in <hi rend="italic">Life Illustrated</hi> on December 8, 1855. A line in that article reads: "The writer of this article has a statement from Dr. Lepsius, the indefatigable Egyptian traveler and decipherer, that he is satisfied, from inscriptions and other proofs he has found in one of these piles in Ethiopia, that it is of the age of ten thousand years!"</p>
