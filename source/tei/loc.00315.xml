            <l><title>TO THE SUN-SET BREEZE.</title></l>
     <l>Ah, whispering, something again, unseen,</l>
     <l>Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window, door,</l>
     <l>Thou, laving, tempering all, cool-freshing, gently vitalizing</l>
     <l>Me, old, alone, sick, weak-down, melted-worn with sweat;</l>
     <l>Thou, nestling, folding close and firm yet soft, companion bet-<lb/>
             ter than talk, book, art,</l>
     <l>(Thou hast, O Nature! <choice><sic>e!ements!</sic><corr>elements!</corr></choice> utterance to my heart be-<lb/>
             yond the rest&#8212;and this is of them,)</l>
     <l>So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe within&#8212;thy soothing<lb/>
             fingers on my face and hands,</l>
     <l>Thou, messenger-magical strange bringer to body and spirit of<lb/>
             me</l>
     <l>(Distances balk'd&#8212;occult medicines penetrating me from head<lb/>
             to foot.)</l>
     <l>I feel the sky, the prairies vast&#8212;I feel the mighty northern<lb/>
             lakes,</l>
     <l>I feel the ocean and the ofrest&#8212;somehow I feel the globe<lb/>
             itself swift-swimming in space;</l>
     <l>Thou blown from lips so loved, now gone&#8212;haply from end-<lb/>
             less store, God-sent</l>
     <l>(For thou art spiritual, Godly, most of all known to my<lb/>
             sense,)</l>
     <l>Minister to speak to me, here and now, what word has never<lb/>
             told, and cannot tell,</l>
     <l>Art thou not universal concrete's distillation? Law's, all As-<lb/>
             Astronomy's last refinement?</l>
     <l>Hast thou no soul? Can I not know, identify thee?</l>
