    <note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman's note in the top margin of the recto suggests this manuscript was composed in January 1863. Union soldier Thomas A. Morrison was injured December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and he was hospitalized in Washington beginning as early as late December 1862. He remained there until he was discharged in late April 1863, when he returned to his native Pennsylvania (Charles Blanchard, ed., "Judge Thomas Anderson Morrison," <hi rend="italic">The Progressive Men of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</hi> [Logansport, IN: A.
