        <note type="project" target="#dat1">The canceled notes on the recto may have been composed between late December 1861 and December 1864. According to Whitman, the "Hospital" notes at the bottom of the page were composed while Union soldier Lewis Francis was in a Washington hospital. By Francis's testimony, he was in a Washington hospital for at least a week after December 21, 1861 but before April 16, 1862 ("Testimony of Lewis Francis," <hi rend="italic">The Reports of the Committees of the Senate of the United States of the Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress</hi> [1861&#8211;'62], 36). Francis was wounded in the first Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 and returned home to Brooklyn in the spring of 1862. The draft letter on the verso is likely related to Whitman's editorial about the general exchange of prisoners, versions of which were published in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</hi> on December 27, 1864.</note>
