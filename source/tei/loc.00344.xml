     <p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught<subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a071">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a071">/</metamark></add></subst> if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it show'd me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous'd (of course, I don't mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions)&#8212;that only from the strong glare and provocation of that war's sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.</p>
     <p>I went down to the war fields in Virginia (end of 1862), lived thenceforward in camp&#8212;saw great battles and the days and nights afterward&#8212;partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous'd, courage evoked&#8212;death readily risk'd&#8212;<hi rend="italic">the cause</hi>, too&#8212;along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, 1863&#8211;'64&#8211;'65&#8212;the real parturition years (more than 1776&#8211;'83) of this henceforth homogenous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, "Leaves of Grass" would not now be existing.</p>
     <p>But I set out with the intention also of indicating or hinting some point-characteristics which I since see (though I did not then, at least not definitely) were bases and object-urgings toward those "Leaves" from the first. The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last, is the word Suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought&#8212;there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus-word is Comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledg'd sense than hitherto. Other word-signs would be Good Cheer, Content, and Hope.</p>
     <p>The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of Humanity and Nature&#8212;the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. What kind of temper and what amount of faith report these things? Up to how recent a date is the song carried? What the equipment, and special raciness of the singer&#8212;what his tinge of coloring? The last value of artistic expressers, past and present&#8212;Greek <add hand="#h02" place="inline"><metamark function="add" target="#a052"/></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a052">&#230;</add>sthetes, Shakspere&#8212;or in out own day Tennyson, Victor Hugo, Carlyle, Emerson&#8212;is certainly involv'd in such questions. I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect, or supply something polish'd and interesting, nor even to depict great passions, or persons or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <hi rend="italic">good heart</hi> as a radical possession and habit. The educated world seems to have been growing more and more ennuyed for ages, leaving to our time the inheritance of it all. Fortunately there is the original inexhaustible fund of buoyancy, normally resident in the race, forever eligible to be appeal'd to and relied on.</p>
     <p>As for native American individuality, thought certain to come, and on a large scale, the distinctive and ideal type of Western character (as consistent with the operative political and even money-making features of United States' humanity in the Nineteenth Century as chosen knights, gentlemen and warriors were the ideals of the centuries of European feudalism) it has not yet appear'd. I have allow'd the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it&#8212;not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy&#8212;and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant "the great pride of man in himself," and permit it to be more or less a <hi rend="italic">motif</hi> of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p>
     <p>Democracy has been so retarded and jeopardized by powerful personalities, that its first instincts are fain to clip, conform, bring in stragglers, and reduce everything to a dead level. While the ambitious thought of my song is to help the forming of a great aggregate Nation, it is, perhaps, altogether through the forming of myriads of fully develop'd and enclosing individuals. Welcome as are equality's and fraternity's doctrines and popular education, a certain liability accompanies them all, as we see. That primal and interior something in man, in his soul's abysms, coloring all, and , by exceptional fruitions, giving the last majesty to him&#8212;something continually touch'd upon and attain'd by the old poems and ballads of feudalism, and often the principal foundations of them&#8212;modern science and democracy appear to be endangering, perhaps eliminating. But that forms an appearance only; the reality is quite different. The new influences, upon the whole, are surely preparing the way for grander individualities than ever. To-day and here personal force is behind everything, just the same. The times and depictions from the Iliad to Shakspere inclusive can happily never again be realized&#8212;but the elements of courageous and lofty manhood are unchanged.</p>

     <p>Without yielding an inch the working-man and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which the Greek and feudal poets endow'd their god-like or lordly born characters&#8212;indeed prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those&#8212;I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and to-day, are eligible to the grandest and the best&#8212;more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances (I said to myself before beginning) to be in spirit the poems of the morning. (They have been founded an mainly written in the sunny forenoon and early midday of my life.) I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wish'd to put the complete Union of the States in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be jsut as much South as North&#8212;just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic&#8212;in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, and on the shores of Puget Sound.</p>
     <p>From another point of view "Leaves of Grass" is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality&#8212;though meanings that do not usually go along with those words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women towards the thought and fact of sexuality, as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. The vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance&#8212;like the clef of a symphony. As last analogy the lines I allude to, and the spirit in which they are spoken, permeate all "Leaves of Grass," and the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety.</p>
     <p>Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always calling in the doctor for the consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that "heroic nudity"<metamark function="link">*</metamark> on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editions of "Leaves of Grass" in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p>

Ever since what might be call'd thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ("to justify the ways of God to man" is Milton's well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, ever concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each.</p>

     enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p>
     <p>One main genesis-motive of the "Leaves" was my conviction (just as strong to-day as ever) that the crowning growth of the United States is to be spiritual and heroic. To help start and favor that growth&#8212;or even to call attention to it, or the need of it&#8212;is the beginning, middle and final purpose of the poems. (In fact, when really cipher'd out and summ'd to the last, plowing up in earnest the interminable average fallows of humanity&#8212;not "good government" merely, in the common sense&#8212;is the justification and main purpose of these United States.)</p>
     <p>Isolated advantages in any rank or grace or fortune&#8212;the direct or indirect threads of all the poetry of the past&#8212;are in my opinion distasteful to the republican genius, and offer no foundation for its fitting verse. Establish'd poems, I know, have the very great advantage of chanting the already perform'd, so full of glories, reminiscences dear to the minds of men. But my volume is a candidate for the future. "All original art," says Taine, anyhow, "is self-regulated, and no original art can be regulated from without; it carries its own counterpoise, and does not receive it from elsewhere&#8212;lives on its own blood"&#8212;a solace to my frequent bruises and sulky vanity.</p>
     <p>As the present is perhaps mainly an attempt at personal statement or illustration, I will allow myself as further help to extract the following anecdote from a book, "Annals of Old Painters," conn'd by me in youth. Rubens, the Flemish painter, in one of his wanderings through the galleries of old convents, came across a singular work. After looking at it thoughtfully for a

           Such ripples, half-caught voices, echo from the shore.</p>
     <p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West, when it worthily rises&#8212;First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish'd and select few; Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p>

How the soul loves to float amid such reminiscences!</p>
     <p>So here I sit gossiping in the early candle-light of old age&#8212;I and my book&#8212;casting backward glances over our travel'd road. After completing, as it were, the journey&#8212;(a varied jaunt of years, with many halts and gaps of intervals&#8212;or some lengthen'd ship-voyage, wherein more than once the last hour had apparently arrived, and we seem'd certainly going down&#8212;yet reaching port in a sufficient way through all discomfitures at last)&#8212;After completing my poems, I am curious to review them in the light of their own (at the time unconscious, or mostly unconscious) intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody. These lines, therefore, will probably blend the weft of first purposes and speculations, with the warp of that experience afterwards, always bringing strange developments.</p>

K., Boston, May 28, f1884)&#8212;And that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special offical buffetings&#8212;is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenc'd. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions. As fulfill'd, or partially fulfill'd, the best comfort of the whole business (after a small band of the dearest friends and upholders ever vouchsafed to man or cause&#8212;doubtless all the more faithful and uncompromising&#8212;this little phalanx!&#8212;for being so few) is that, unstopp'd and unwarp'd by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record&#8212;the value thereof to be decided by time.</p>
     <p>In calculating that decision, William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke are for more peremptory than I am. Behind all else that can be said, I consider "Leaves of Grass" and its theory experimental&#8212;as, in the deepest sense, I consider our American republic itself to be, with its theory. <add hand="#h04" place="above"><metamark function="add" target="#a065"/></add><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a065">(<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a065">/</metamark></add>I think I have at least enough philosophy not to be too absolutely certain of any thing, or any results.<add hand="#h04" place="above"><metamark function="add" target="#a066"/></add><add hand="#h04" place="left" xml:id="a066">)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a066">/</metamark></add> In the second place, the volume is a <hi rend="italic">sortie</hi>&#8212;whether to prove triumphant, and conquer its field of aim and escape and construction, nothing less than a hundred years from now can fully answer.

     <p>My Book and I&#8212;what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to <subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">'6</del><add seq="2" place="above" rend="marked">'8</add></subst>0&#8212;and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be, if we have cull'd enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it in the future!</p>
     <p>Let me not dare, here or anywhere, for my own purposes, or any purposes, to attempt the definion of Poetry, not answer the question what it is. Like Religion, Love, Nature, while those terms are indispensable, and we all give a sufficiently accurate meaning to them, in my opinion no definition that has ever been made sufficiently encloses the name Poetry; nor can any rule or convention ever so absolutely obtain but some great exception my arise and disregard and overturn it.</p>
     <p>Also it must be carefully remember'd that first-class literature does not shine by any luminosity of its own; nor do its poems. They grow of circumstances, and are evolutionary. The actual living light is always curiously from elsewhere&#8212;follows unaccountable sources, and is lunar and relative at the best. There are, I know, certain controling themes that seem endlessly appropriated to the poets&#8212;as war, in the past&#8212;in the Bible, religious rapture and adoration&#8212;always love, beauty, some fine plot, or pensive or other emotion. But, strange as it may sound at first, I will say there is something striking far deeper and towering far higher than those themes for the best elements of modern song.</p>
     <p>Just as all the old imaginative works rest, after their kind, on long trains of presuppositions, often entirely unmention'd by themselves, yet supplying the most important bases of them, and without which they could have had no reason for being, so "Leaves of Grass," before a line was written, presupposed something different from any other, and, as it stands, is the result of such presupposition. I should say, indeed, it were useless to attempt reading the book without first carefully tallying that preparatory background and quality in the mind. Think of the United States to-day&#8212;the facts of these thirty-eight or forty empires solder'd in one&#8212;sixty or seventy millions of equals, with their lives, their passions, their future&#8212;these incalculable, modern, American, seething multitudes around us, of which we are inseparable parts! Think, in comparison, of the petty environage and limited area of the poets of past or present Europe, no matter how great their genius. Think of the absence and ignorance, in all cases hitherto, of the multitudinousness, vitality, and the unprecedented stimulants of to-day and here. It almost seems as if a poetry with cosmic and dynamic features of magnitude and limitlessness suitable to the human soul, were never possible before. It is certain that a poetry of absolute faith and equality for the use of the democratic masses never was.</p>
     <p>In estimating first-class song, a sufficient Nationality, or, on the other hand, what may be call'd the negative and lack of it<add hand="#h04" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a068">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h04" place="right" xml:id="a068">,<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a068">/</metamark></add> (as in Goethe's case, it sometimes seems to me,) is often, if not always, the first element. One needs only a little penetration to see, at more or less removes, the material facts of their country and radius, with the coloring of the moods of humanity at the time, and its gloomy or hopeful prospects, behind all poets and each poet, and forming their birth-marks. I know very well that my "Leaves" could not possibly have emerged or been fashion<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a069">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a069">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d or completed, from any other era than the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, nor any other land that democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.</p>
     <p>And whether my friends claim it for me or not, I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done, or could do. But it seem'd to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of &#230;stheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of <hi rend="italic">their point of view</hi>,<ref xml:id="r2" target="#n2"><metamark function="link">*</metamark></ref> the time had</p>

     <p>Even Shakspere, who so suffuses current letters and art (which indeed have in most degrees grown out of him,) belongs essentially to the buried past. Only he holds the proud distinction for certain important phases of that past, of being the loftiest of the singers life has yet given voice to. All, however, relate to and rest upon conditions, standards, politics, sociologies, ranges of belief, that have been quite eliminated from the Eastern hemisphere, and never existed at all in the Western. As authoritative types of song they belong in America just about as much as the persons and institutes they depict. True, it may be said, the emotional, moral, and &#230;sthetic natures of humanity have not radically changed&#8212;that in these the old poems apply to our times and all times, irrespective of date; and that they are of incalculable value as pictures of the past. I willingly make those admissions, and to their fullest extent; then advance the points herewith as of serious, even paramount importance.</p>
     <p>I have indeed put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell'd poetic bequests, and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncover'd head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written "Leaves of Grass." My verdict and conclusions as illustrated in its pages are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else&#8212;perhaps more than through anything else. As America fully and fairly construed is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the New World needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.</p>

     <p>Continuing the subject, my friends have more than once suggested&#8212;or may be the garrulity of advancing age is possessing me&#8212;some further embryonic facts of "Leaves of Grass," and especially how I enter'd upon them. Dr. Bucke has, in his volume, already fully and fairly described the preparation of my poetic field, with the particular and general plowing, planting, seeding, and occupation of the ground, till everything was fertilized, rooted, and ready to start its own way for good or bad. Not till after all this, did I attempt any serious acquaintance with poetic literature. Along in my sixteenth year I had become possessor of a stout, well-cramm'd one thousand page octavo

     Lockhart's 1833 (or '34) edition with Scott's latest and copious revisions and annotations. (All the poems were thoroughly read by me, but the ballads of the Border Minstrelsy over and over again.)</note>
       <p>Later, at intervals, summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's seashores&#8212;there, in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room&#8212;it makes such difference <hi rend="italic">where</hi> you read<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a073">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a073">/</metamark></add></subst> Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante's among them. As it happen'd, I read the latter mostly in an old wood. The Iliad (Buckley's prose version<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">),</del><add seq="2" place="right" xml:id="a074">,)<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a074">/</metamark></add></subst> I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast end of Long Island, in a shelter'd hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wonder'd since why I was not overwhelm'd by those mightly masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscape and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p>
       <p>Toward the last I had among much else look'd over Edgar Poe's poems&#8212;of which I was not an admirer, tho' I always saw that beyond their limited range of melody (like perpetual chimes of music bells, ringing from lower <hi rend="italic">d</hi> flat up to <hi rend="italic">g</hi>) they were melodious expressions, and perhaps never excell'd ones, of certain pronounc<subst hand="#h04"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">e</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a075">'<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a075">&#711;</metamark></add></subst>d phases of human morbidity. (The Poetic area is very spacious&#8212;has room for all&#8212;has so many mansions!) But I was repaid in Poe's prose by the idea that (at any rate for our occasions, our day) there can be no such thing as a long poem. The same thought had been haunting my mind before, but Poe's argument, though short, work'd the sum out and proved it to me.</p>
       <p>Another point had an early settlement, clearing the ground greatly. I saw, from the time my enterprise and questionings positively shaped themselves (how best can I express my own distinctive era and surroundings, America, Democracy?) that the trunk and centre whence the answer was to radiate, and to which all should return from straying however far a distance, must be an identical body and soul, a personality&#8212;which personality, after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself&#8212;indeed could not be any other. I also felt strongly (whether I have shown it or not) that to the true and full estimate of the Present both the Past and the Future are main considerations.</p>

        <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and little American poems&#8212;all that diligent and long-continued research could lay hands on! The author of 'Old Grimes is Dead' commenced it, more than fifty years ago; then the cluster was pass'd on and accumulated by C. F. Harris; then further pass'd on and added to by the late Senator Anthony, from whom the whole collection has been bequeath'd to Brown University. A catalogue (such as it is) has been made and publish'd of these five thousand poems&#8212;and is probably the most curious and suggestive part of the whole affair. At any rate it has led me to some abstract reflection like the following.</p>
        <p>I should like, for myself, to put on record my devout acknowledgment not only of the great masterpieces of the past, but of the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poets, past and present, and of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> poetic utterance&#8212;in its entirety the dominant moral factor of humanity's progress. In view of that progress, and of evolution, the religious and &#230;sthetic elements, the distinctive and most important of any, seem to me more indebted to poetry than to all other means and influences combined. In a very profound sense <hi rend="italic">religion is the poetry of humanity</hi>. Then the points of union and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world, however wide their separations of time and place and theme, are much more numerous and weighty than the points of contrast. Without relation as they may seem at first sight, the whole earth's poets and poetry&#8212;<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>&#8212;the Oriental, the Greek, and what there is of Roman&#8212;the oldest myths&#8212;the interminable ballad-romances of the Middle Ages&#8212;the hymns and psalms of worship&#8212;the epics, plays, swarms of lyrics of the British Islands, or the Teutonic old or new&#8212;or modern French&#8212;or what there is in America, Bryant's, for instance, or Whittier's or Longfellow's&#8212;the verse of all tongues and ages, all forms, all subjects, from primitive times to our own day inclusive&#8212;really combine in one aggregate and electric globe or universe, with all its numberless parts and radiations held together by a common centre or verteber. To repeat it, all poetry thus has (to the point of view comprehensive enough) more features of resemblance than difference, and becomes essentially, like the planetary globe itself, compact and orbic and whole. Nature seems to sow countless seeds&#8212;makes incessant crude attempts&#8212;thankful to get now and then, even at rare and long intervals, something approximately good.</p>

        <head type="sub">90 THE OLD BOWERY.</head>
        <p>Doom'd" and the yet undying "Mazeppa." At one time "Jonathan Bradford, or the Murder at the Roadside Inn," had a long and crowded run; John Sefton and his brother William acted in it. I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste, a splendid pantomimist, and her emotional "Wept of the Wishton-Wish." But certainly the main "reason for being" of the Bowery Theatre those years was to furnish the public with Forrest's and Booth's performances&#8212;the latter having a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics fully equal to the former&#8212;though people were divided as always. For some reason or other, neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements at the more fashionable theatre, the Park. And it is a curious reminiscence, but a true one, that both these great actors and their performances were taboo'd by "polite society" in New York and Boston at the time&#8212;probably as being too robustuous. But no such scruples affected the Bowery.</p>
        <p>Recalling from that period the occasion of either Forrest or Booth, any good night at the old Bowery, pack'd from ceiling to pit with its audience mainly of alert, well dress'd, full-blooded young and middle-aged men, the best average of American-born mechanics&#8212;the emotional nature of the whole mass arous'd by the power and magnetism of as mighty mimes as ever trod the stage&#8212;the whole crowded auditorium, and what seeth'd in it, and flush'd from its faces and eyes, to me as much a part of the show as any&#8212;bursting forth in one of those long-kept-up tempests of hand-clapping peculiar to the Bowery&#8212;no dainty kid-glove business, but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2000 full-sinew'd men&#8212;(the inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those ovations to Edwin Forrest, welcoming him back after an absence, comes up to me this moment)&#8212;Such sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely afford to many old New Yorkers some fruitful recollections.</p>
        <p>I can yet remember (for I always scann'd an audience as rigidly as a play) the faces of the leading authors, poets, editors, of those times&#8212;Fenimore Cooper, Bryant, Paulding, Irving, Charles King, Watson Webb, N. P. Willis, Hoffman, Halleck, Mumford, Morris, Legget<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a096">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="left" rend="underline" xml:id="a096"><metamark target="#a096">(Leggett) 2</metamark>t</add>, L. G. Clarke, R. A. Locke and others, occasionally peering from the first tier boxes; and even the great National Eminences, Presidents Adams, Jackson, Van Buren and Tyler, all made short visits there on their Eastern tours.</p>
        <p>Awhile after 1840 the character of the Bowery as hitherto described completely changed.

        <head type="sub">NEW ORLEANS IN 1848. 101</head>
        <p>were given throughout by such a situation. I remember the crowds of soldiers, the gay<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d023">,</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d023">d</metamark></add> young officers, going or coming, the receipt of important news, the many discussions, the returning wounded, and so on.</p>
        <p>I remember very well seeing Gen. Taylor with his staff and other officers at the St. Charles Theatre one evening (after talking with them during the day.) There was a short play on the stage, but the principal performance was of Dr. Colyer's troupe of "Model Artists," then in the full tide of their popularity. They gave many fine groups and solo shows. The house was crowded with uniforms and shoulder-straps. Gen. T. himself, if I remember right, was almost the only officer in civilian clothes; he was a jovial, old, rather stout, plain man, with a wrinkled and dark-yellow face, and, in ways and manners, show'd the least of conventional ceremony or etiquette I ever saw; he laugh'd unrestrainedly at everything comical. (He had a great personal resemblance to Fenimore Cooper, the novelist, of New York.) I remember Gen. Pillow and quite a cluster of other militaires also present.</p>
        <p>One of my choice amusements during my stay in New Orleans was going down to the old French Market, especially of a Sunday morning. The show was a varied and curious one; among the rest, the Indian and negro hucksters with their wares. For there were always fine specimens of Indians, both men and women, young and old. I remember I nearly always on these occasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit, for my breakfast, from the immense shining copper kettle of a great Creole mulatto woman (I believe she weigh'd 230 pounds.) I never have had such coffee since. About nice drinks, anyhow, my recollection of the "cobblers" (with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers,) and also the exquisite wines, and the perfect and mild French brandy, help the regretful reminiscence of my New Orleans experiences of those days. And what splendid and roomy and leisurely bar-rooms! particularly the grand ones of the St. Charles and St. Louis. Bargains, auctions, appointments, business conferences, &amp;c., were generally held in the spaces or recesses of these bar-rooms.</p>
        <p>I used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the crowded and bustling levees, on the banks of the river. The diagonally wedg'd-in boats, the stevedores, the piles of cotton and other merchandise, the carts, mules, negroes, etc., afforded never-ending studies and sights to me. I made acquaintances among the captains, boatmen, or other characters, and often had long talks with them&#8212;sometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters. Sundays I sometimes went</p>

        <p>began to feel that the manner in which I sometimes amus'd myself with my gun was not without sin; for although I mostly preferr'd going alone, and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl, my mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations, that the opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me; yet, on other occasions, when accompanied by some of my acquaintances, and when no fowls appear'd which would be useful to us after being obtain'd, we sometimes, for wantonness or for mere diversion, would destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us. This cruel procedure affects my hears while penning these lines.</p>
        <p>In his 23d year Elias was married, by the Friends' ceremony, to Jemima Seaman. His wife was an only child; the parents were well off for common people, and at their request the son-in-law mov'd home with them and carried on the farm&#8212;which at their decease became his own, and he liv'd there all his remaining life. Of this matrimonial part of his career, (it continued, and with unusual happiness, for <hi hand="#h06" rend="underline" xml:id="j022"><subst hand="#h02"><del seq="1" rend="overstrike">60</del><add seq="2" place="left" xml:id="a098">58<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a098">/</metamark></add></subst></hi><del hand="#h06" rend="overstrike"><add  hand="#h06" place="right"><metamark function="adjust" target="#j022"><unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ew">Sec &amp;</unclear> 125</metamark></add></del> years,) he says, giving the account of his marriage:</p>
        <p>On this important occasion, we felt the clear and consoling evidence of divine truth, and it remain'd with us as a seal upon our spirits, strengthening us mutually to bear, with becoming fortitude, the vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot, and of which we had a large share in passing through this probationary state. My wife, although not of a very strong constitution, liv'd to be the mother of eleven children, four sons and seven daughters. Our second daughter, a very lovely, promising child, died when young, with the small-pox, and the youngest was not living at its birth. The rest all arriv'd to years of discretion, and afforded us considerable comfort, as they prov'd to be in a good degree dutiful children. All our sons, however, were of weak constitutions, and were not able to take care of themselves, being so enfeebl'd as not to be able to walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age. The two eldest died in the fifteenth year of their age, the third in his seventeenth year, and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died. But, although thus helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the resign'd cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments, made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and pleasant; and I trust we were preserv'd from murmuring or repining, believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and according to the will and gracious disposing of an all-wise providence, for purposes best known to himself. And when I have observ'd the great anxiety and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who are favor'd with health, especially their sons, I could perceive very few whose troubles and exercises, on that account, did not far exceed ours. the weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations of the world; and we believ'd that in their death they were happy, and admitted into the realms of peace and joy: a reflection, the most comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their tender offspring.</p>
        <p>Of a serious and reflective turn, by nature, and from his reading and surroundings, Elias had more than once markedly devotional inward intimations. These feelings increas'd in frequency and strength, until soon the following:</p>

        <p>Third day. I was busied most of this day in my common vocations. Spent the evening principally in reading Paul. Found considerable satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians; in which he shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth without looking through and beyond the instrument, to the great first cause and Author of every blessing, to whom all the praise and honor are due.</p>
        <p>Fifth day, 1st of 4th month. At our meeting to-day found it, as usual, a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center'd where it ought to be. What a multitude of intruding thought imperceptibly, as it were, steal into the mind, and turn it from its proper object, whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against them. Felt a little strength, just at the close, to remind Friends of the necessity of a steady perseverance, by a recapitulation of the parable of the unjust judge, showing how men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</p>
        <p>Sixth day. Nothing material occurr'd, but a fear lest the cares of the world should engross too much of my time.</p>
        <p>Seventh day. Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends, whom I have long lov'd. The rest of the day I employ'd in manual labor, mostly in gardening.</p>
        <p>But we find if we attend to records and details, we shall lay out an endless task. We can briefly say, summarily, that his whole life was a long religious missionary life of method, practicality, sincerity, earnestness, and pure piety&#8212;as near to his time here, as one in Judea, far back&#8212;or in any life, any age. The reader who feels interested must get&#8212;with all its dryness and mere dates, absence of emotionality or literary quality, and whatever abstract attraction (with even a suspicion of cant, sniffling,) the "Journal of the Life and Religious Labours of Elias Hicks, written by himelself," at some Quaker book-store. (It is from this <hi hand="#h02" rend="circled">headquarters I have extracted <del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d024">from</del><add hand="#h02" place="right"><metamark function="delete" target="#d024">d</metamark></add> the preceding</hi> quotations.) During E. H.'s matured life, continued from fifty to sixty years&#8212;while working steadily, earning his living and paying his way without intermission&#8212;he makes, as previously memorandised, several hundred preaching visits, not only through Long Islan, but some of them away into the Middle or Southern States, or north into Canada, or the then far West&#8212;extending to thousands of miles, or filling several weeks and sometimes months. These religious journeys&#8212;scrupulously accepting in payment only his transportation from place to place, with his own food and shelter, and never receiving a dollar of money for "salary" or preaching&#8212;Elias, through good bodily health and strength, continues till quite the age of eighty. It was thus at one of his latest jaunts in Brooklyn city I saw and heard him. This sight and hearing shall now be described.</p>
        <p>Elias Hicks was at this period in the latter part (November or December) of 1829. It was the last tour of the many missions</p>

A moment looking around the audience with him and the whole scene now.) Then the words come from his lips, very emphatically and slowly pronounc'd, in a resonant, grave, melodious voice, <hi rend="italic">What is the chief end of man?</hi> I was told in my early youth, <hi rend="italic">it was to glorify God, and seek and enjoy him forever.</hi></p>
        <p>I cannot follow the discourse. It presently becomes very fervid, and in the midst of its fervor he takes the broad-brim hat from his head, and almost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind, continues with uninterrupted earnestness. But, I say, I cannot repeat, hardly suggest his sermon. Though the differences and disputes of the formal division of the Society of Friends were even then under way, he did not allude to them at all. A pleading, tender, nearly agonizing conviction, and magnetic stream of natural eloquence, before which all minds and natures, all emotions, high or low, gentle or simple, yielded entirely without exception, was its cause, method, and effect. Many, very many were in tears. Years afterward in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the sailor's preacher, and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the resemblance to Elias Hicks's&#8212;not argumentative or intellectual, but so penetrating&#8212;so different from anything in the books&#8212;(different as the fresh air of a May morning or sea-shore breeze from the atmosphere of a perfumer's shop.) While he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing-song tone sometimes heard in such meetings; but in a moment or two more, as if recollecting himself, he breaks off, stops, and resumes in a natural tone. This occurs three or four times during the talk of the evening, till all concludes.</p>
        <p>Now and then, at the many scores and hundreds&#8212;even thousands&#8212;of his discourses&#8212;as at this one&#8212;he was very mystical and radical,<ref xml:id="r6" target="n6"><metamark function="link">&#967;</metamark></ref> and had much to say of "the light within." Very

The solemn composure at this time manifest in his counterance, was very impressive, indicating that he was sensible the time of his departure was at hand, and that the prospect of death brought no terrors with it. During his last illness, his mental faculties were occasionally obscured, yet he was at times enabled to give satisfactory evidence to those around him, that all was well, and that he felt nothing in his way.</p>
        <p>His funeral took place on fourth day, the 3d of 3d month. It was attended by a large concourse of Friends and others, and a solid meeting was held on the occasion; after which, his remains were interr'd in Friends' burial-ground at this place (Jericho, Queens County, New York.)</p>
        <p>I have thought (even presented so incompletely, with such fearful hiatuses, and in my own feebleness and waning life) one might well memorize this life of Elias Hicks. Though not eminent in literature or politics or inventions or business, it is a token of not a few, and is significant. Such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiers&#8212;but I have thought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a sample&#8212;that this one specially does. I have already compared it to a little flowing liquid rill of Nature's life, maintaining freshness. As if, indeed, under the smoke of battles, the blare of trumpets, and the madness of contending hosts&#8212;the screams of passion, the groans of the suffering, the parching of struggles of money and politics, and all hell's heat and noise and competition <hi rend="circle" hand="#h02">above and around</hi><add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a100">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a100">&#8212;<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a100">/</metamark></add><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="right" rend="underline">Price</note> should come melting down from the mountains from sources of unpolluted snows, far up there in God's hidden, untrodden recesses, and so rippling along among us low in the ground, at men's very feet, a curious little brook of clear and cool, and ever-healthy, ever-living water.</p>

Probably it had been preparing some time. One who was present has since described to me the climax, at a meeting of Friends in Philadelphia crowded by a great attendance of both sexes, with Elias as principal speaker. In the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these words: "The blood of Christ&#8212;the blood of Christ&#8212;why, my friends, the actual blood of Christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood of bulls and goats&#8212;not a bit more&#8212;not a bit." At these words, after a momentary hush, commenced a great tumult. Hundreds rose to their feet. . . . Canes were thump'd upon the floor. From all parts of the house angry mutterings.</p>

           <l>I sent my soul through the Invisible,</l>
           <l>Some letter of that after-life to spell,</l>
           <l>And by-and-by my soul return'd to me,</l>
           <l>And answer'd, "I myself am Heaven and Hell."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Indeed, of this important element of the theory and practice of Quakerism, the difficult-to-describe "Light within" or "Inward Law, by which all must be either justified or condemn'd," I will not undertake where so many have fail'd&#8212;the task of making the statement of it for the average comprehension. We will give, partly for the matter and partly as specimen of his speaking and writing style, what Elias Hicks himself says in allusion to it&#8212;one or two of very many passages. Most of his discourses, like those of Epictetus and the ancient peripatetics, have left no record remaining&#8212;they were extempore, and those were not the times of reporters. Of one, however deliver'd in Chester, Pa., toward the latter part of his career, there is a careful transcript; and from it (even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to be pick'd and thrash'd out several times before you get the grain,) we give the following extract:</p>
        <p>"I don't want to express a great many wor<hi hand="#h06" xml:id="j025" rend="underline">a</hi><add hand="#h06" place="right"><metamark target="#j025">?</metamark></add>s; but I want you to be call'd home to the substance. For the Scriptures, and all the books in the world, can do no more; Jesus could do no more than to recommend to this Comforter, which was the light in him. 'God is light, and in him is no darkness at all; and if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.' Because the light is one in all, and therefore it binds us together in the bonds of love; for it is not only light, but love&#8212;that love which casts out all fear. So that they who dwell in God dwell in love, and they are constrain'd to walk in it; and if they 'walk in it, they have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.'</p>
        <p>"But what blood, my friends? Did Jesus Christ, the Saviour, ever have any material blood? Not a drop of it, my friends&#8212;not a drop of it. That blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin, was the life of the soul of Jesus. The soul of man has no material blood; but as the outward material blood, created from the dust of the earth, is the life of these bodies of flesh, so with respect to the soul, the immortal and invisible spirit, its blood is that life which God breath'd into it.</p>
        <p>"As we read, in the beginning, that 'God form'd man of the dust of the ground, and breath'd into him the breath of life, and man became a living soul.' He breath'd into that soul and it became alive to God."</p>

        <p>We all know how much <hi rend="italic">mythus</hi> there is in the Shakspere question as it stands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf'd far more dim and elusive ones, of deepest importance&#8212;tantalizing and half suspected suggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point, the English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances (my maturest judgement confirming the impressions of my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the contests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we get it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism&#8212;personifying in unparallel'd ways the medi&#230;val aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)&#8212;only one of the "wolfish earls" so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works&#8212;works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.</p>
        <p>The start and germ-stock of the pieces on which the present speculation is founded are undoubtedly (with, at the outset, no small amount of bungling work) in "Henty VI." It is plain to me that as profound and forecasting a brain and pen as ever appear'd in literature, after floundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogy&#8212;or perhaps draughting it more or less experimentally <hi hand="#h06" rend="circle"><hi hand="#h02" rend="circle">or by accident&#8212;afterward develop<add hand="#h02" place="below"><metamark function="add" target="#a103">&#8248;</metamark></add><add hand="#h02" place="right" xml:id="a103">ed<metamark function="emphasize" target="#a103">/</metamark></add></hi> and defined his</hi><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="right">Piece</note> plan in the Second and Third Parts, and from time to time, thenceforward, systematically enlarged it to majestic and mature proportions in "Richard II," "Richard III," "King John," "Henry IV," "Henry V," and even in Macbeth," "Coriolanus" and "Lear."

        <head>ROBERT BURNS AS POET AND PERSON.</head>
        <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">HAT</hi> the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works&#8212;what place will be assign'd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which can only be finish'd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries with their ample average&#8212;I of course cannot tell. But as we know him, from his recorded utterances, and after nearly one century, and its diligence of collections, songs, letters, anecdotes, presenting the figure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully complete, and the lines mainly by his own hand, he forms to-day, in some respects, the most interesting personality among singers. Then there are many things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to America. He was essentially a Republican&#8212;would have been at home in the Western United States, and probably become eminent there. He was an average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud spirited, amative, alimentive, convival, young and early-middle-aged man of the decent-born middle classes everywhere and any how. Without the race of which he is a distinct specimen, (and perhaps his poems) America and her powerful Democracy could not exist to-day&#8212;could not project with unparallel'd historic sway into the future.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first to be consider'd. It included the times of the '76&#8211;'83 Revolution in America, of the French Revolution, and an unparallel'd chaos develop<del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike" xml:id="d025"><hi hand="#h06" rend="underline" xml:id="j026">e</hi></del><add hand="#h02" place="left"><metamark function="delete" target="#d025">&#977;</metamark></add><del hand="#h02" rend="overstrike"><note type="editorial" hand="#h06" place="left">?<metamark target="#j026">/</metamark></note></del>ment in Europe and elsewhere.

And while so much, and of grandest moment, fit for the trumpet of the world's fame, was being transacted&#8212;that little tragi-comedy of R. B.'s life and death was going on in a country by-place in Scotland!</p>
        <p>Burns's correspondence, generally collected and publish'd since his death, gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak (and worse than weak) parts of his portraiture, habits, good and bad luck, ambition and associations. His letters to Mrs. Dunlop, Mrs. McLehose, (Clarinda,) Mr. Thompson, Dr. Moore, Robert Muir, Mr. Cunningham, Miss Margaret Chalmers, Peter Hill,</p>
