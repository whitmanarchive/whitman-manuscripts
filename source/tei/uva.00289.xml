            <p>This manuscript was probably early notes toward the manuscript poem "Pictures,"<!--xxx.00614--> first published posthumously in 1925. That poem includes the following lines: "And here again, this picture tells a story of the Olympic games, / See you, the chariot races? See you, the boxers boxing, and the runners running?" and "This, again, is a Spanish bull-fight—see, the animal with bent head, fiercely advancing" (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi>, ed. Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 4:1298–1300). Part of "Pictures" was published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880 and later incorporated into <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>.</p>

            <p>This note may also relate to the images described in "Poem of Salutation," first published in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> and later retitled "Salut au Monde!" See in particular the following lines: "You citizen of Prague! you Roman! Napolitan! Greek! / You lithe matador in the arena at Seville!" (1856, p. 117).</p>

                <note type="project" target="#dat1">The poem proposed here is likely related to both "Pictures," a lengthy manuscript poem held at the Beinecke Library at Yale University that was probably written in the mid- to late-1850s, and "Poem of Salutation," first published in the 1856 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> and later retitled "Salut au Monde!" Therefore, the date of this manuscript is probably before 1856.</note>
