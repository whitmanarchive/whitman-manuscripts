            <p>The true friends of the Sabbath, and of its purifying and elevating influences, and of the many excellent physical and other reforms that mark the present age, are not necessarily those who complacently put themselves forward and seek to carry the good through by penalties and stoppages and arrests and fines.&#8212;The true friends of <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">elevation and</add> reform are the friends of the fullest rational liberty. For there is this vital and antiseptic power in liberty, that it tends forever and ever to strengthen what is good and erase what is bad.&#8212;Compulsion is a temporary support, causing much bad blood and certain reaction.&#8212;</p>
