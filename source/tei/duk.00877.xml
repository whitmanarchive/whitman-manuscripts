            <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript is an adaptation of notes Whitman took about Egypt, almost certainly based on his reading of Sir John Gardner Wilkinson's <hi rend="italic">Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians</hi>, 3 vols. (London: John Murray, 1837). Related information about Sesostris appears on page 29 of the first volume in Wilkinson's collection, though Whitman may have been reading a different edition. Whitman used the information in his article "One of the Lessons Bordering Broadway: The Egyptian Museum," published in <hi rend="italic">Life Illustrated</hi> on December 8, 1855. Similar descriptions of Sesostris appear in several of Whitman's other notes and manuscripts, including "<ref target="/manuscripts/marginalia/annotations/mid.00018.html">Immortality was realized</ref>" and "<ref target="/manuscripts/marginalia/annotations/tex.00200.html">Abraham's visit to Egypt</ref>," two sets of manuscript notes about Egypt that Edward Grier dates to between 1855 and 1860 (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1922; 6:2022); the notebook "<ref target="/manuscripts/notebooks/transcriptions/loc.05589.html">women</ref>;" and the poetic rendition "<ref target="/manuscripts/transcriptions/tex.00028.html">Advance shapes like his shape</ref>." The manuscript is pasted to a larger document along with another scrap, the reverse of which features prose notes that relate to what became section 2 of "I Sing the Body Electric," first published as the fifth poem in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Both manuscripts were probably written shortly before or early in 1855, though the notes on the backing sheet to which they have been pasted may have been written at a later date.</note>
