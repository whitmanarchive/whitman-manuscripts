                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Edward Grier postulates that this manuscript was probably written in the 1850s. The identity of the "large, good-looking woman" and the source of the story about Tom Thumb are unknown, though Grier notes that Whitman interviewed P. T. Barnum in 1847, Thumb visited the Midwest with Barnum's circus after 1851, and Thumb made an 1854 appearance with the circus in Brooklyn. For further details, see <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:244. It is possible that this may have been draft fragments or notes toward intended pieces of fiction.</note>

            <p>A large, good-looking woman, wife of a farmer, has had twelve children; every one of whom died before living a year.—The woman has some serious inward disease, which, the doctor says would have killed her long ago had she not borne children; and that, when she has a child born that lives and grows <del rend="overstrike">well and</del> perfectly <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">well,</add> the woman herself will die.—</p>

            <p>When <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">my little friend</add> Tom Thumb, travelled with the circus he stood behind the stand, in a Missouri settlement, one afternoon, and sold notions.—Amid the crowd, came up the biggest kind of a Western bully, and presently demanded the change <subst><add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" seq="2">due him on</add> <del rend="overstrike" seq="1">for</del></subst> the dollar.—. . . . ."O, yes," says Tom, "all but the dollar."—Then crowds the louping giant closer up and cries, "Damn your little heart, <choice><orig>didnt</orig><reg>didn't</reg></choice> I <del rend="overstrike">just</del> buy three cigars, and give you a dollar bill half an hour ago?". . . . . .Tom was up to Western rigs, and couldn't be persuaded for he had <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1">taken</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2">handled</add></subst> nothing but change and a gold quarter-eagle since he open<add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear">e</add>d trade. On stating this, the baffled ruffian sings out, "Then I lie, do I?—Take that to remember me <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear">by</add>!" and reaching over his long arm <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1">like</del> <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" seq="2">like a windmill in a gale,</add></subst> hits the poor boy a staggerer that brings the blood from his nose and raises a purple cushion around one eye in short metre.—</p>
