Mrs. Moffitt's Hotel, 8 Bulfinch place, 
was the scene of a very pleasant and 
animated gathering on Saturday night. 
Walt Whitman invited around him his 
printers, proof-readers, pressmen (from 
Rand &amp; Avery's establishment, where 
the new "Leaves of Grass" has just been set-
up and electrotyped), and, with other 
friends added, gave them, an informal 
reception, with a fraternal hand-shake 
and hearty word of welcome for each. 
Several ladies called, and a number of 
"outsiders," and all were received with 
due empressment. There were over three 
hundred visitors in the course of the <orig reg="evening">even-</orig>
ing, some from England. At ten o'clock 
Mrs. Moffitt furnished the old poet and 
his special printer friends (over eighty 
of them) with a fine champagne supper. All 
was bountiful, but unconventional. Mr. 
Whitman gave some items of his printer life, 
as a young man (1838 to 1850), and 
his working in different cities from New 
York to New Orleans, inclusive, followed, 
in answer to queries, by brief opinions on 
the political situation. He held that 
there is really no first-class problem 
in our government now demanding solution; 
that we are nationally doing well 
enough; <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" hand="h1">and</add> that the process of <orig reg="fraternizing">frater-</orig>
nizing, the main thing, is being surely 
and silently fulfilled in all the States<add place="inline" rend="unmarked" hand="h1">,</add> 
               <del rend="overstrike" hand="h1">that 
great toleration and forbearance should be 
observed toward President Arthur, who 
has, in some respects, the most perplexing 
part to play of any President since <orig reg="Washintgon">Wash-</orig>
ington.</del> In the course of the evening various 
little speeches were made, and Mr. <orig reg="Whitman">Whit-</orig>
man recited "John Anderson, My Jo, 
John."</p>
            <p>The poet departs to-morrow, after a <orig reg="sojourn">so-</orig>
journ in Boston of which, to use his own 
words, he "could not wish for a more 
beautiful and comforting two months."</p>

hundred pages of "Leaves of Grass" 
the student, both of literature and of 
humanity, can but wonder at the 
strange power that manifests itself in 
every paragraph. They may criticise 
the form of expression, may question 
the taste of certain passages, but the 
overlying grace of the poet and the 
underlying spirit of the philanthropist

            <p>WALT WHITMAN is the poet of 
democracy, of strict and absolute 
equality, who exalts woman alike 
with man. He is the poet of <orig reg="powerful">power-</orig>

side of HOMER and the Bible that 
equals the splendor of his imagery or 
the elevation of an occassional <orig reg="passage">pas-</orig>

tary verse under the heading of 
<hi rend="underline">"Drum Taps"</hi> contain matchless <orig reg="descriptions">de-</orig>
scriptions of scenes of camp and battle, 
unequalled by those of any modern 
writer. "Autumn Rivulets" and 
"From Noon to Starry Night" are 
full of indescribable flights. Quoting 
from the closing poem again, "So 
Long," the poet prophesies of what 
shall come after him:</p>
