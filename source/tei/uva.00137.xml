         <p>Parts of this manuscript, especially the second line, might have contributed to the following passage in the preface and to the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>: "Does the young man think often of him? and the young woman think often of him? and do the middleaged and the old think of him?"

            <note type="project">This manuscript may have been written in the early 1850s, as Whitman was preparing material for the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The language and imagery in the manuscript are similar to language and imagery used in the preface to that edition and in the first poem, eventually titled "Song of Myself."</note>
