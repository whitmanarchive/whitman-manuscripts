      mirror—long it lay clouded, but
      the cloud has pass'd away," and "This, (I name every thing as it
      comes,) This is a beautiful statue,
      long lost, dark buried, but never
      destroyed—and now found by me,
      and again restored to the light." The "five old men" also appear in "Pictures." The first several lines of the notebook version of "Pictures" were revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880.

      <p>The "Poem of Fables" as such never materialized, but a poem simply titled "Fables" was incorporated into the second section of the poem "Passage to India," first published in 1871.</p>
