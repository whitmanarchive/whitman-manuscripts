            <note type="project" target="dat1">This manuscript was probably written between 1850 and 1860. The lines are similar in subject to lines in the poem "To One Shortly to Die," first published in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The use of ellipses within poetic lines was characteristic of Whitman's first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, however, and lines in this manuscript also resemble lines that appeared in the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself." On the upper right corner of the manuscript appear the words "note last page of 'Ghost-seers'" in Whitman's hand, which may be a reference to one of the two volumes of <hi rend="italic">The Night Side of Nature, Or, Ghosts and Ghost-Seers</hi>, by Catherine Crowe (London: T. C. Newby, 1848; G. Routledge &amp; Co., 1852). Whitman mentioned the book in a conversation with Horace Traubel on <ref target="../../criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/6/med.00006.85.html">December 9, 1889</ref> (<hi rend="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</hi>, 6:180–2). The phrase "Ghost-seers" also recalls a statement regarding Emerson in "Leaves-Droppings," a section of correspondence and commentary Whitman appended to the 1856 edition: "[Emerson] sees the future of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man..."</note>

         <p>The lines in this manuscript are similar in subject to lines in the poem "To One Shortly to Die," first published in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. See, for instance, the line: "You are to die—Let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate" (1860, p. 398).</p>

         <p>This manucript also bears some resemblance to the following lines from the poem that would eventually be titled "Song of Myself": "To any one dying . . . . thither I speed and twist the knob of the door, /
            Turn the bedclothes toward the foot of the bed, /
            Let the physician and the priest go home" (1855, p. 45).</p>
