            <p>Phrases in this manuscript are similar to phrases that appeared in the poem that would later be titled "A Song for Occupations." See, for instance: "It is for you whoever you are . . . . it is no farther from you than your hearing and sight are from you, / It is hinted by nearest and commonest and readiest . . . . it is not them, though it is endlessly provoked by them" (1855, p. 59).</p>

            <p>Phrases in this manuscript are also similar to phrases that appeared in the poem that would later be titled "Song of Myself." See, for instance: "I take my place among you as much as among any," (1855, p. 48); "Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself" (1855, p. 54); "What is commonest and cheapest and nearest and easiest is Me" (1855, p. 21).</p>

            <p>This manuscript also bears some resemblance to the following lines in "Salut au Monde!," first published in 1856 as "Poem of Salutation": "Stretched in due time within me the midnight sun
                just rises above the horizon, and sinks again; / Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plains, volca-
                noes, groups, / Oceanica, Australasia, Polynesia, and the great
                West Indian islands" (1856, p. 104).</p>
