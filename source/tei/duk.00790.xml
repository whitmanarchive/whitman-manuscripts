            <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript chronicles part of Whitman's return journey from New Orleans in 1848. The descriptions in this manuscript of the "[l]ong monotonous stretch of the Mississippi" and the "[p]ainful effect of the excessive flatness of the country" found their way, in an altered form, into "New Orleans in 1848," an article that appeared in the <hi rend="italic">New Orleans Picayune</hi> on January 25, 1887. The article was later reprinted in <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi>. The manuscript therefore can be dated conclusively to between 1848 and 1887, but the handwriting and sketchiness of the notes—perhaps the result of on-the-spot notetaking—would suggest a date early in that range.</note>
