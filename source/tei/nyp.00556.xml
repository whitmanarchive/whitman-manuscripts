                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript consists of notes about Whitman's family history. The various dates referenced suggest that the earliest portions of it were written sometime after 1845, and most of the notes seem to have been written at various stages between 1845 and 1855. Edward Grier dates the recto to 1850, and speculates that the earliest date for the writing on the verso is likely March 1853, when the two Cumberland Street houses were sold (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:8). For footnotes relating the names listed here to Whitman, see Grier. Whitman made additions to the manuscript several times, adding to it for the last time sometime around 1861. One of the names referenced on the verso, Covert, appears as a character in both Whitman's short story "<ref target="../../published/fiction/shortfiction/per.00340.html">Revenge and Requital</ref>" (1845) and his novel <hi rend="italic">Life and Adventures of Jack Engle</hi> (1852). The name is also mentioned in an early notebook draft of the plot of <hi rend="italic">Jack Engle</hi> (see "<ref target="../notebooks/transcriptions/loc.04588.html">a schoolmaster</ref>").</note>

            <p><handShift new="#h3"/>Sarah White, my great grandmother Whitman, lived to be 90 years old.—She was a large, strong woman, chewed tobacco, opium &amp;c.—petted her slaves, and had always a crowd of little niggers about her.—She would sit with her feet up before the fire, just like a man—was every way decided and masculine in behavior</p>
            
            <p>The tradition of my grandfather, Jesse Whitman, was that there were four brothers, Englishmen <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">his remote ancestors</add> who came over here.—One settled on Long Island—West Hills was formerly inhabited and owned very largely by Whitmans.—</p>
