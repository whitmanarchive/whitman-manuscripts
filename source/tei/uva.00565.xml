         <p>These lines correspond to a line from the manuscript poem, unpublished in Whitman's lifetime, titled "Pictures": "And now a merry recruiter passes, with fife and drum, seeking who will join his troop."

            <note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman probably drafted this manuscript in the 1850s. The lines are versions of a line in a long manuscript poem titled "<ref target="yal.00081.html">Pictures</ref>," which probably dates to the mid- to late 1850s. Based on the first-person perspective in these draft lines, Emory Holloway has speculated that they likely were written after the line in "Pictures" (<hi rend="italic">Pictures: An Unpublished Poem of Walt Whitman</hi> [New York: The June House, 1927], 31). The first several lines of "Pictures" (not including this line) were eventually revised and published as "My Picture-Gallery" in <hi rend="italic">The American</hi> in October 1880. The poem was later published in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as part of the "Autumn Rivulets" cluster.</note>
