         <p>This manuscript includes language similar to the following line, from the poem ultimately titled "A Song for Occupations": "Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains or by
            river-banks, men around feeling the melt
            with huge crowbars—lumps of ore, the due
            combining of ore, limestone, coal—the blast-
            furnace and the puddling-furnace, the loup-
            lump at the bottom of the melt at last —
            the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron,
            the strong clean-shaped T rail for rail-
            roads" (1856, pp. 133&#8211;4). A version of "A Song for Occupations" first appeared in the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, though the line associated with this manuscript was not added to the poem until the 1856 edition. The title of the poem shifted throughout the editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, and included the following variants: "Chants Democratic," "The Workingmen," and "Carol of Occupations." Whitman finally settled on the title "A Song for Occupations" in the 1881–1882 edition.</p>

         <p>This manuscript also resembles the following lines from the poem eventually titled "Song of the Broad-Axe": "There is the mine, there are the miners,
            The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accom-
            plished, the hammers-men are at hand with
            their tongs and hammers" (1856, p. 150).</p>
