         <p>The language and topic of this manuscript resemble those of Whitman's self-authored review of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, "Walt Whitman and His Poems": "We shall start an athletic and defiant literature. We realize now how it is, and what was most lacking. The interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent. . . . Where is the tremendous outdoors of these States? Where is the majesty of the federal mother, seated with more than antique grace, calm, just, indulgent to her brood of children, calling them around her regarding the little and the large and the younger and the older with perfect impartiality? Where is the vehement growth of our cities? Where is the spirit of the strong rich life of the American mechanic, farmer, sailor, hunter, and miner? Where is the huge composite of all other nations, cast in a fresher and brawnier matrix, passing adolescence, and needed this day, live and arrogant, to lead the marches of the world?" The review was published in <hi rend="italic">The United States Review</hi> in September, 1855. It was also part of a series of reviews printed separately and included in some copies of the 1855 edition.</p>
