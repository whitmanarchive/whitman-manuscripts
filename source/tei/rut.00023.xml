                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Edward Grier suggests that this manuscript was probably written prior to 1860, noting some similarities in language and sentiment between it and the initial line of No. 4 of the "Thoughts" cluster published first in the
                    <date when="1860">1860–1861</date> edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:118). The erased final line of the manuscript is also similar to language that appears in the preface to the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The manuscript is held at Rutgers University Library along with several similar manuscripts that are numbered sequentially and probably date from around or before 1855: see "<ref target="rut.00010.html">American literature must become distinct</ref>," "<ref target="rut.00022.html">dithyrambic trochee</ref>," "<ref target="rut.00024.html">The money value of real</ref>," and "<ref target="rut.00025.html">ground where you may rest</ref>."</note>
