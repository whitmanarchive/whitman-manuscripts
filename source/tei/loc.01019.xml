                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This cancelled prose manuscript was probably written between 1850 and 1855. Language in the manuscript was used in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, in the poem that was eventually titled "Song of Myself." Segments of the manuscript also resemble language that appeared in the preface to the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> and in the 1856 "Poem of Perfect Miracles," later titled "Miracles." The wording of "the vast elemental sympathy, which, only the human soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods," was used, slightly revised, in "A Song of Joys," which first appeared in the 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as "Poem of Joys."</note>
