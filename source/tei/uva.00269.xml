            <p>The first line in this manuscript matches a line that appears next to others in the "Talbot Wilson" notebook (recto leaf 38) that eventually made their way into the poem that would be titled "Song of Myself." Later lines in the manuscript also include images and words that may relate to those that appeared in the poem, including, for instance: "I speak the password primeval . . . . I give the sign of democracy;" (1855, p. 29) and "I am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser of things to be. / My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs, /  On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps, / All below duly traveled—and still I mount and mount" (1855, p. 50).</p>

        <p>The opening line of this manuscript also bears some resemblance to a line in the poem eventually titled "I Sing the Body Electric": "Suchlike I love . . . . I loosen myself and pass freely . . . . and am at the mother's
            breast with the little child," (1855, p. 78).</p>

                <note type="project" target="dat1">Whitman probably drafted this
                    manuscript in the <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1855">early 1850s</date> as he was composing
                    the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The first line in this manuscript matches a line in the "<ref target="../notebooks/transcriptions/loc.00141.html">Talbot Wilson</ref>" notebook (recto leaf 38), and is similar in structure to lines that appeared in the first poem in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, eventually titled "Song of Myself." The image of the poet navigating stairs also appears in what would become section 44 of "Song of Myself."</note>
