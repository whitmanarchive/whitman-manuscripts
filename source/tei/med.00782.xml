        <work ref="xxx.00526" cert="low"><p>The language and ideas in this manuscript are reminiscent of phrases and ideas Whitman used in the preface to the first (1855) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Compare, in particular, the following passages from that edition: "the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors" (p. iii); "the President's taking off his hat to them not they to him" (p. iii); and "take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men" (p. vi).</p></work>
