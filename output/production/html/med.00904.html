Richard Maurice Bucke (London, Ontario: A. Talbot &amp; Co. [printer], 1899), 46.  The location of this manuscript is unknown.

The phrase "path worn in the grass" appears in the 1855 poem eventually titled "Song of Myself." Language in the manuscript is also similar to language that appears in the poem "Poem of Joys" (1860), eventually titled "Song of Joys"; "A Farm Picture" (1867); and the manuscript poem "<a href="yal.00081" class="internal_link">Pictures</a>." Although Bucke has grouped the lines together in his transcription, there is also a possibility that they represent three separate manuscripts.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Caitlin Henry, Nicole Gray, Ashlyn Stewart, Kevin McMullen</li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content">
