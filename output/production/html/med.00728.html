Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances or date of its composition, but it seems likely that it was written in the early to mid-1850s.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Brett Barney, Kenneth M.
