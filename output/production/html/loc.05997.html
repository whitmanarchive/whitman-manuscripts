Whitman leaves out the balloonist's name, but it is likely that he is referring to the ascent of Victor Vardelle on September 19, 1849. A number of announcements of the event had appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> in the days leading up to the launch, and the launch itself was reported in an unsigned story in the issue of September 20. However, it is highly unlikely that Whitman was the author of that piece; while Whitman had written for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span>, his position at the paper was terminated in January 1848, and none of the specific wording from this manuscript appears in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span> article. At the time of the September 19 balloon launch, Whitman was apparently between jobs; having announced his resignation from the Brooklyn <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freeman</span> on September 11, 1849, he would begin publishing his series "Letters from a Travelling Bachelor" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sunday Dispatch</span> in October 1849. No published version of this blurb of Whitman's has been located, but it is almost certain that the date of composition was shortly after the balloon launch, in September 1849. On the verso is a note written by antiquarian bookseller, collector, and Whitman bibliographer Alfred Goldsmith (1881–1947). </span></span></li><li><strong>Notes written on manuscript: </strong> On leaf 1 verso, in Alfred Goldsmith's hand: "Whitman mss—in pencil | This piece of mss. is entirely in the holograph of Walt Whitman.
