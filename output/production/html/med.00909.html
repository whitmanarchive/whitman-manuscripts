The phrasing and imagery are reminiscent of passages in the first poem of the 1855 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, suggesting that this manuscript was composed before or early in 1855. </span></span></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_med_00909 main_content">
