The language in the manuscript is similar to language in the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself."</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Caitlin Henry, Nicole Gray, Ashlyn Stewart, Kevin McMullen</li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content">
