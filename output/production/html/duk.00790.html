The descriptions in this manuscript of the "[l]ong monotonous stretch of the Mississippi" and the "[p]ainful effect of the excessive flatness of the country" found their way, in an altered form, into "New Orleans in 1848," an article that appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Orleans Picayune</span> on January 25, 1887. The article was later reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span>. The manuscript therefore can be dated conclusively to between 1848 and 1887, but the handwriting and sketchiness of the notes—perhaps the result of on-the-spot notetaking—would suggest a date early in that range.</span></span></li><li><strong>Notes written on manuscript: </strong>On leaf 1 recto, in unknown hand: "(9"; on leaf 1 verso, in unknown hand: "9"; on leaf 2 recto, in unknown hand: "10"</li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Nicole Gray, Kirsten Clawson, Janel Cayer, Kenneth M.
