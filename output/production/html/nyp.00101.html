Bucke's transcription concludes with the following words, which do not currently appear on the manuscript: "where they fail of themselves" (55). In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Regenerate Lyric</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), Elisa New attributes the manuscript to "the period when the first drafts of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> were taking shape" (112).
