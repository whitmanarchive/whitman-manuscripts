The manuscript note about the "superb wonder of a blade of grass" may relate to similar statements in the prose preface and the first poem in that edition, eventually titled "Song of Myself." In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes and Fragments</span>, Richard Maurice Bucke transcribes the manuscript with "<a href="nyp.00112" class="internal_link">Enter into the thoughts of</a>" and describes it as "a very early note, the paper torn and almost falling to pieces."</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Kenneth M.
