Richard Maurice Bucke (London, Ontario: A. Talbot &amp; Co., printers, 1899), 124.</span></span> The location of this manuscript is unknown.

The discussion of "the poetic quality" and the punctuation (at least as rendered by earlier editors) are similar to the preface to the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, so it is possible that the composition date was before or early in 1855.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Brett Barney, Kenneth M.
