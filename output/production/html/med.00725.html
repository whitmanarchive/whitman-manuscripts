Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances or date of its composition, but it seems likely that parts of it were written at different times between 1848 and the publication of Whitman's article "New Orleans in 1848: Walt Whitman Gossips of His Sojourn Here Years Ago as a Newspaper Writer: Notes of His Trip Up the Mississippi and to New York," which probably drew on these notes, in the New Orleans <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Picayune</span> on January 25, 1887. Edward Grier notes that "H." and "M'C" probably refer to publishers A. H. Hayes and J. E. McClure. Stefan Schöberlein has established that Holloway's "Da Poute" (which Grier speculates should possibly be "Da Ponte") refers to Durant DaPonte (1830-1894).</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Brett Barney, Stefan Schöberlein, Kenneth M.

            <p class="tei_p">1848 New Orleans/ March 18th. We have now been publishing "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Crescent</span>," two weeks; and it seems to be going ahead handsomely. My situation is rather a pleasant one. I get through at evening much earlier than I had anticipated, which I like, of course, very well. There are many peculiarities in New Orleans that I shall jot down at my leisure in these pages. It seems somewhat strange that I have not heard from home. It is now over a month, and no letter yet.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">(I arrived in New Orleans, on the night of Friday Feb. 25th; and left it Saturday afternoon, May 27th, '48.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">On board steamer <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Griffith</span> Upper part of Lake Huron, Saturday morning, June 10th, 1848.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">For a few weeks after I commenced my duties at New Orleans, matters went on very pleasantly. People seemed to treat me kindly, particularly H. and M'C. My health was most capital; I frequently thought indeed that I felt better than ever before in my life. After changing my boarding house, Jef. and I were, take it altogether, pretty comfortable. We had good beds, and though the noise was incessant, day and night, we slept well. The plan of going to dinner when we liked, and calling for what we wanted, out of a variety of dishes, was more convenient than the usual way of boarding houses.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Through some unaccountable means, however, both H. and M'C, after a while, exhibited a singular sort of coldness, toward me, and the latter an irritability toward Jef., who had, at times, much harder work than I was willing he should do.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The arrangements of the office were in this wise: I generally went about my work about 9 o'clock, overhauling the papers <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  by mail, and "making up the news," as it is called, both with pen and scissors. A Mr. Larue (a good writer,) generally prepared the leading editorials; Mr. Reeder, (an amiable-hearted young man, but excessively intemperate) was the "city news" man; (poor Reeder is dead, since) and a young fellow named <span class="tei_supplied tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_ss">DaPonte</span>, officiated as translator of Mexican and foreign n—items; factotum in general. I had been accustomed to having frequent conferences, in my former situations with the proprietors of newspapers, on the subject of management, etc. But when the coldness above alluded to broke out, H. seemed to be studiously silent upon all these matters. My own pride was touched—and I met their conduct with equal haughtiness on my part. On Wednesday May 24th I sent down a note requesting a small sum of money. M'C returned me a bill of what money I had already drawn, and stated that they could not make "advances." I answered by reminding them of certain points which appeared to have been forgotten, making me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> their debtor, and told them in my reply I thought it would be better to dissolve the connection. They agreed to my plan (after some objections on the part of me); and I determined to leave on the succeeding Saturday.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Accordingly on Friday I packed up my traps, and <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away">[cut away]</span></p>
