Edward Grier notes that the name "Bill Guess" does not appear in New York directories from this time period. Two entries for "George Fitch" are listed in the New York City directory for 1855–56.  One Fitch is listed as an expressman, and the other is listed as a clerk. Grier postulates that "the three young men mentioned here were probably itinerant omnibus drivers" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:199). George Fitch is also mentioned in the manuscript titled "<a href="duk.00294" class="internal_link">Bloom</a>." </span></span></li><li><strong>Related Item(s): </strong><ul><li><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_project tei_note_target_rel01 note"><span>On the back of this leaf is a draft of lines that appeared in the first poem of the 1855 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, which was ultimately titled "Song of Myself." </span></span> See <a href="duk.00051">duk.00051</a>.</li><li> See <a href="wwa.00065">wwa.00065</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Jennifer R.
