            <p class="tei_p">These three days, we have been on a visit, (father and myself,) to West Hills, the old native place.—We went up in the L. I. RR., and so in the stage to Woodbury—then on foot, along the turnpike and "across lots" to Colyer's.—I plumped in the kitchen door.—Aunt S. <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">(father's sister)</sup> was standing there—I knew her at once, although it is very many years since I saw her, and she looked very old and bent.

            <p class="tei_p">Richard Colyer died about five years ago.—Hannah, the widow, is <span class="tei_subst"><del class="tei_del tei_del_rend_overwrite tei_del_seq_1">s</del><span class="tei_add tei_add_rend_overwrite tei_add_place_over tei_add_seq_2">c</span></span>ertainly a clever hearted creature; she made us very welcome, and was evidently sincere about it.—Hard work, losing her husband, and some troubles among her children, have made her a little vaporish, and she complains of bad health.—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Andrew, the eldest son, is a good natured young man, and good-hearted as the world goes.—He married some three years since, but is separated from his wife.—His little boy is with him—being withdrawn from its mother.—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Charles, the other son is a boy of 16.—Harriet married Edgar Hewlett—he now lives <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">(he died <span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1853-09">Sept '53.</span>)</sup> in New York—drives cart.—Sarah married Lemuel Carll—he lives on his father's place, at the Hills. <sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_unmarked tei_add_place_supralinear">In the summer of <span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1851">'51</span>, he bought a farm, <del class="tei_del tei_del_rend_overstrike tei_hand tei_handNote_scribeRef_ww tei_handNote_medium_pencil tei_del_hand_h2">and</del> at Woodbury and moved on it.</sup></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Aunt S. is indeed an original.—She has very little regard for dress; but is craving for money and property.—She has always shown a masculine, determined mind.—Soon after her marriage, (<span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">to one</sup> Walters,) her husband took to drink; she separated from him, and

            <p class="tei_p">West Hills is a romantic and beautiful spot; it is the most hilly and elevated part of Long Island.—The "high hill" affords an extensive and pleasant view.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The old grave yard, on the Hill has some new graves.—The Whitmans must have been a race of <del class="tei_del tei_del_rend_overstrike">some</del> note; there are I should say as many as fifty graves there—and it is only their private family burying ground.—Besides this, many <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">others</sup> of them must have been buried at Huntington village, for I remember seeing numerous old grave stones that were brought from their graves, at the time of the Revolutionary war—for the British encamped on the Huntington hill, and took away grave stones for ovens <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_1 tei_gap_unit_word">[illegible]</span> and hearths, &amp;c.—The stones I saw were brought away, lest they might be despoiled, and somehow, when the war passed over, they were never returned.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The Whitmans were among the earliest settlers of that part of Long Island—West Hills, township of Huntington, county of Suffolk, New York.—They must have originally come from <span class="tei_subst"><del class="tei_del tei_del_rend_overwrite tei_del_seq_1">the</del><span class="tei_add tei_add_rend_overwrite tei_add_place_over tei_add_seq_2">some</span></span> rural district of England—a stalwart, massive, heavy, long-lived race.—They appear to have been always of democratic and heretical tendencies.—Some of them are yet represented by descendants in New England</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My father's grandfather was quite a large territorial owner in that part of Long Island, and also on the southern shore of the town.—They all espoused with ardor the side of the "rebellion" in 76.—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I remember when a boy hearing grandmother Whitman tell about the times of the revolutionary war.—The British had full swing over Long Island, and foraged every where, and committed the most horrible excesses—enough to make one's blood boil even to hear of now.—My father's father I never saw.—</p>
