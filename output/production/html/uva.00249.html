The manuscript is written on the blank side of an 1850s tax form from the City of Williamsburgh. Scholars, following Fredson Bowers, have generally assumed that Whitman used the Williamsburgh tax forms from 1857 to 1860, while he was working at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</span>. The city of Williamsburgh was incorporated with Brooklyn effective January 1855, so the forms would have been obsolete after that date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass</span> [1860] [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955], xli–xliii). Most of the manuscripts Whitman wrote on the tax forms can be dated to the late 1850s. Bowers also notes, however, that Whitman may have used the forms over a considerable span of time, and that "it is not impossible that Whitman had picked up these tax forms for scrap paper at Rome Brothers at some unknown date in 1854 or early 1855, or later" (xliii). At least two of the tax forms Whitman used were dated 1854 (see, for instance, "<a href="loc.05354" class="internal_link">Vast national tracts</a>"), but as Edward Grier points out, this may not correspond to the date of Whitman's writing (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 5:1946). Whitman may have found a stack of obsolete Williamsburgh forms in 1857 that included discarded draft forms dated earlier. The manuscript is thus difficult to date conclusively, but it was almost certainly written after 1854 and probably before 1860. </span></span></li><li><strong>Notes written on manuscript: </strong> On leaf 1 recto, in unknown hand: "<del class="tei_del tei_del_rend_erasure">4</del>"</li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_uva_00249 main_content">
