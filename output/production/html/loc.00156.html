Written at the bottom of the notes are two lines of poetry. The manuscript is written in pencil on both sides of a narrow strip of lined paper, cut from a larger sheet. Based on the handwriting, Edward Grier dates this manuscript to the 1850s (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 1:320). </span></span></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_loc_00156 main_content">
