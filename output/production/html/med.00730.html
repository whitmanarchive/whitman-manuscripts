The manuscript's language and phrasing resembles that of the early editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, so it is possible that it was written in the 1850s or 1860s.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Kenneth M.
