"Leaves-Droppings" was the name given to a section of correspondence and reviews that Whitman included in the back of the 1856 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. It seems he also considered giving that title to the cluster of poems in the 1860 edition that was eventually titled "Enfans d'Adam." Given that this manuscript contains a proposal for a poem, it's possible that Whitman envisioned it being included in the "Enfans d'Adam" cluster, suggesting a composition date in the late 1850s. However, as the "Leaves-Droppings" title had been on his mind as early as 1855 or 1856, it's also possible that this scrap was written earlier. </span></span></li><li><strong>Related Item(s): </strong><ul><li><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_project tei_note_target_rel01 note"><span>On the back of this manuscript are poetic lines that may have contributed to the second poem in the 1855 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, a poem eventually titled "A Song for Occupations." </span></span> See <a href="loc.00013">loc.00013</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_loc_07512 main_content">
