Whitman's entry, dated September 3, 1841, is one of several on the page.  Whitman evidently visited the school again the following year (see <a href="med.00723" class="internal_link">med.00723</a>).  Although he lists himself as "of Suffolk co. LI." in this note, and he had worked in Long Island as a school teacher from 1839 to early 1841, Whitman had moved to Manhattan in May 1841 and was writing and working in journalism (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>, rev. ed. [Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1985], 34–42). In August 1841, he had published a short story about a cruel schoolmaster, "<a href="per.00317" class="internal_link">Death in the School-Room</a>," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Democratic Review</span>.   </span></span></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_med_00724 main_content">
