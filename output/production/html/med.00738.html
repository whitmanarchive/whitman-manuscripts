Grier dates the manuscript to the 1850s, perhaps based on its appearance in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes and Fragments</span> along with transcriptions of other early manuscripts owned by Bucke.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Brett Barney, Kenneth M.
