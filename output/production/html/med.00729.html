The sentence that begins "The soul has that measureless pride..." also later became part of the poem "Song of Prudence." Because the manuscript has not been located it is difficult to speculate on the circumstances of its composition, but it was probably written before or early in 1855. </span></span></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_med_00729 main_content">
