Whitman's entry is one of several on the page.  The entry is dated January 12, and it can be inferred from the surrounding dates that the year is 1842. Whitman had also visited the school the previous year (see <a href="med.00724" class="internal_link">med.00724</a>). Although he had worked in Long Island as a school teacher from 1839 to early 1841, Whitman had moved to Manhattan in May 1841 and was working as a journalist (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>, rev. ed. [Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1985], 34â€“42). In August 1841, he had published a short story about a cruel schoolmaster, "<a href="per.00317" class="internal_link">Death in the School-Room</a>," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Democratic Review</span>.</span></span></li><li><strong>Contributors to digital file: </strong>Janel Cayer, Jeannette Schollaert, Kevin McMullen, Nicole Gray, Brett Barney, Kenneth M.
