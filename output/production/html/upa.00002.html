Possibly this is a very early draft of the poem "To Thee Old Cause," which first appeared in the 1871 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. However, Whitman used the term "good old cause" as early as the 1855 edition, where it appears in the Preface. The phrase probably originated in England during the seventeenth century, shortly after the English Civil War, and was frequently used by Whitman (see Clarence Gohdes, "Whitman and the 'Good Old Cause,'" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span> 34.3 [November 1962]: 400–403). Aided by the earlier work of Richard Maurice Bucke in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes and Fragments</span> (1899), Edward Grier suggests that this manuscript likely was written prior to 1860 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 4:1329). The titles of both of the proposed poems ("Poem of...") suggest the title format of the 1856 edition. The second proposed poem, titled "Poem of the People," is not known to have led to a published work. </span></span></li></ul></div><div id="whitman_main_content" class="item_upa_00002 main_content">
